1 | INTRODUCTION
Abstract
In this work, we develop SiOx/poly-Si carrier-selective contacts grown by low
pressure chemical vapor deposition and boron or phosphorus doped by ion implanta
tion. We investigate their passivation properties on symmetric structures while
varying the thickness of poly-Si in a wide range (20-250 nm). Dose and energy of
implantation as well as temperature and time of annealing were optimized, achieving
implied open-circuit voltage well above 700 mV for electron-selective contacts
regardless the poly-Si layer thickness. In case of hole-selective contacts, the passiv
ation quality decreases by thinning the poly-Si layer. For both poly-Si doping types,
forming gas annealing helps to augment the passivation quality. The optimized doped
poly-Si layers are then implemented in c-Si solar cells featuring SiO2/poly-Si contacts
with different polarities on both front and rear sides in a lean manufacturing process
free from transparent conductive oxide (TCO). At cell level, open-circuit voltage
degrades when thinner p-type poly-Si layer is employed, while a consistent gain in
short circuit current is measured when front poly-Si thickness is thinned down from
250 to 35 nm (up to +4 mA/cm[2]). We circumvent this limitation by decoupling front
and rear layer thickness obtaining, on one hand, reasonably high current (JSC-EQE =
38.2 mA/cm[2]) and, on the other hand, relatively high VOC of approximately 690 mV.
The best TCO-free device using Ti-seeded Cu-plated front contact exhibits a fill
factor of 75.2% and conversion efficiency of 19.6%.

Very low surface recombination velocity at the c-Si/metal interface is
required to enhance the conversion efficiency of a c-Si solar cell.[1] This
task is successfully achieved by inserting a layer separating the c-Si
absorber from the metal contact, which properly passivates the c-Si
surface and, at the same time, selectively collects one type of
phous silicon (a-Si:H) grown on both sides of c-Si wafer, enabling
open-circuit voltages (VOCs) up to 750 mV.[3] Kaneka has recently
reported a conversion efficiency (η) above 25% for a front-/back
contacted (FBC) c-Si solar cell[4] and a world record efficiency of 26.7%
for an interdigitated back-contacted (IBC) architecture] [4,5]. However,

due to electrical degradation of a-Si:H layers for temperature above
250[]C,[6] such device concept has limited compatibility with standard
solar cell manufacturing processes. An alternative type of CSPC fea
turing higher thermal budget was proposed by Yablonovich et al[7]and
is the so-called semi-insulating polycrystalline silicon (SIPOS) hetero
structure as a mixture of microcrystalline silicon and silicon oxide.
Several research groups [8,9] have recently further developed such
device scheme consisting of an ultra-thin silicon oxide (SiO2) (<2 nm)
layer grown on the c-Si surfaces [10] coated by in situ or ex situ doped
polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) layer deposited via low
pressure/plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (LP/PECVD)
techniques.[11] The thin SiO2 provides excellent chemical passivation of
c-Si interface defects and also acts as a barrier that allows the collec
tion of only majority carriers at poly-Si contact.[12] The transport princi
ple at this junction may occur via tunneling[13,14] and/or via pin-holes
present at c-Si/SiO2 interface.[15] This passivation scheme has proved
to give excellent passivation properties[16] with implied open-circuit
voltage (iVOC) obtained up to 730 mV and saturation current density
(J0) well below 10 fA/cm[2]. Moreover, as typical process temperatures
are above approximately 900[]C, such devices exhibit high thermal sta
bility and are, in principle, compatible with conventional metallization
techniques.
passivation quality is investigated monitoring effective carriers' life
time (τeff), implied open-circuit voltage (iVOC), and saturation current
density (J0). Supported by TCAD simulations, we also evaluate the
effects of doping profile in poly-Si/SiO2/c-Si stack on passivation
quality and band alignment for carrier collection. The investigated
layers are tested on completed devices in a rear emitter configuration
with a textured-front and a flat-rear side in a lean and TCO-free
manufacturing process. We discuss the relation among short-circuit
current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) for
different poly-Si thicknesses.
2 | EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
Double side polished, <100>-oriented, 280-μm-thick, n-type c-Si
float-zone (FZ) wafers with a resistivity of 2.5 Ωcm (Doping concen
tration of 1.810[15] cm[−][3]) are used as starting material to prepare both
symmetric lifetime samples and solar cells. Firstly, the substrates are
cleaned in 99% and 69.5% nitric acid (HNO3) both for 10 minutes in
order to remove organic and metallic particles, respectively. Some
wafers are chemically textured on both sides in an alkaline solution
containing H2O, TMAH, and Alkatex to obtain random pyramids.
Before processing, we remove the native oxide via a short HF dip, and
afterwards, we wet-chemically oxidize the c-Si surfaces using a nitric
acid solution to grow an approximately 1.5-nm-thick SiO2 buffer layer
as described in Yang et al.[17] The samples are then coated with intrin
sic amorphous silicon layer deposited by a Tempress LPCVD reactor
at a temperature of 580[]C, pressure of 150 mTorr, and SiH4 flow of
45 sccm. The deposition time is adapted to obtain layers with thick
ness of 250, 75, 35, and 20 nm. Ex situ doping of the poly-Si layers is
performed via ion implantation using a Varian EHP500 implanter.
Phosphorous (P) and boron (B) are implanted, selecting an energy of
10 keV and 5 keV, respectively, with variable dose from 510[15] to
1.210[16] ions/cm[2]. Figure 1A,B sketches the symmetric samples fabri
cated in this work.
Poly-silicon based CSPCs are successfully applied at cell level
using different device architectures, such as IBC solar cells[17-22]with a
remarkable efficiency over 26%[23] or bifacial[24] and FBC solar cells.[25]
Similarly, promising hybrid concepts combining homo-junction with
poly-Si CSPC are under research as front homo-junction and CSPC at
the back side[26] with experimental η very close to 26% and selective
front surface field (FSF) architecture and rear poly-Si CSPC[27] with
modelled η also in the range of 26%.
Poly-Si has been applied at the front side of FBC solar cells with
transparent conductive oxide (TCO)[28] or with SiNx as anti-reflection
coating[29] for tandem device applications or at the rear side of indus
trial n-type wafer-based FBC cells[30,31] However, placing thick poly-Si
layers at the front side of a solar cell induces consistent parasitic
absorption[32] estimated in the range of 1.5 mA/cm[2] each 30 nm of
poly-Si.[33] Furthermore, poly-Si accounts for free carrier absorption
(FCA) in the near infrared (NIR) wavelength range.[34] Therefore, into
an attempt to obtain more transparent high-thermal budget CSPCs,
poly-Si layer has been alloyed with oxygen[35,36] or carbon[37] and
applied in FBC devices in combination with a-Si:H–based CSPC at the
textured front side.[38,39] Notwithstanding the promising results at both
passivation level and cell level, these alloys are still not optically
optimal[35,40] presenting higher absorption coefficient than c-Si in the
visible range and FCA in the NIR range, just like poly-Si.[41] Thus, to
minimize these optical losses due to poly-Si layers while keeping high
their passivation quality, a careful surface engineering has to be
performed.
Afterwards, the samples are annealed in a tube furnace to acti
vate and diffuse the implanted dopants within the a-Si lattice and,
concurrently, to obtain poly-Si layer. Annealing temperature for sam
ples in Figure 1A,B is either 950[]C or 850[]C, and annealing time is
variable between 5 and 90 minutes, depending on the thickness of
the poly-Si layer. Eventually, a forming gas annealing (FGA) at 400[]C
for 2 hours (10% H2 in N2) is performed to enhance chemical passiv
ation at c-Si/SiO2 interface.[42] Quasi-steady-state photoconductance
lifetime measurements (QSSPC)[43] are performed using a Sinton
Instruments WCT-120 on the symmetric samples in Figure 1A,B to
assess the surface passivation quality of the fabricated structures.
Effective carriers' lifetime (τeff) is evaluated at low injection level
(Δn = 10[15] cm[−][3]); implied open-circuit voltage (iVOC) and recombina
tion current density (J0) are extracted from the measured curves at
high injection level (Δn = 10[16] cm[−][3]). Furthermore, electro
capacitance voltage (ECV) technique is employed on the same
samples to investigate the active doping concentration profile from
In this work, we present the optimization of n- and p-type
implanted poly-Si contacts deposited by LPCVD on top of ultra-thin
chemical SiO2. We optimize both implantation dose/energy and
annealing time/temperature while thinning the poly-Si layer thickness

Solar cells are fabricated by combining the layer stacks optimized
for implantation and annealing performed at optimized
temperature/time depending on the poly-Si thickness. Forming gas
annealing at 400[]C for 2 hours is eventually deployed to increase
chemical passivation. The solar cells are characterized using a cali
brated, class AAA, Wacom WXS-156S solar simulator to extract the
following cell parameters: Voc, FF, Jsc, and η. External quantum effi
ciency (EQE) is measured by an in-house built setup, and a cali
brated mono-silicon diode with known spectral response was used
as a reference. Sinton SunsVOC setup allows to measure pseudo
parameters, such as pseudo-FF (pFF), which excludes the series
resistance contribution.
in a poly-poly configuration (see Figure 1C). The process is shown in
Figure 2. Because our p-type poly-Si layer for textured surface is still
under development, we locate the hole contact at rear side on a flat
interface. The choice of rear-emitter architecture additionally
improves the transport of minority carriers inside c-Si bulk as dis
cussed by Larionova et al[44] and Bivour et al[45] for the case of silicon
heterojunction solar cells. Only the front side of the c-Si wafer is tex
tured (see Figure 2A), by covering the other side with 100-nm-thick
SiNx protective layer. After SiNx removal and cleaning, SiO2 and
doped poly-Si stack are deposited as described above. In particular,
we fabricate devices with 250, 75, and 35 nm of poly-Si layer on both
the front and the rear side.
Accurate opto-electrical simulations of poly-poly solar cells are
performed using a modelling framework based on TCAD
Sentaurus,[47-51]combining thin film optics and opto-electrical proper
ties, such as free carrier absorption. The simulated structure is
reported in Figure 1C using experimentally extracted wavelength
dependent refractive index of poly-Si.[52] From each simulated absorp
tion profile, equivalent photocurrent densities are calculated. We
assume here that all the light absorbed in the front or rear layers
(except the c-Si absorber) is parasitically absorbed and contributes
After tunneling SiO2 formation (see Figure 2B), the LPCVD
intrinsic amorphous silicon layers are implanted with P or B and co
annealed at the optimal temperature according to the passivation
study (see Figure 2C). To minimize reflection losses, a 75-nm-thick
SiNx layer is deposited by PECVD on the textured front side
(see Figure 2D) and finally, the cells are completed with metal con
tacts (see Figure 2E). At rear side, a stack of Ag/Cr/Al (200 nm/30
nm/2 μm) is evaporated through a hard mask to define the cell area
of 2.8 cm × 2.8 cm (7.84 cm[2]), while, at the front side, a 2-μm-thick
e-beam evaporated Al metal grid (5% metal coverage) is structured
via photolithography, etching of SiNx ARC, evaporation, and lift
off.[27] Additionally, the front grid of some solar cells is Cu-plated by
means of a mask-less process (plating current density of
576 mA/cm[2] for 1500 s) using evaporated titanium as seed layer.[46]
For solar cells with decoupled front/rear poly-Si thicknesses, the
fabrication process consists in repeating twice the SiO2/poly-Si
deposition using a SiNx layer to protect one of the wafer's surface
and a poly-Si etching in between. Poly-Si layer is etched in a mix
ture of HF/HNO3 and H2O. We keep the rear side thickness at
250 nm while the front layer is varied from 250 nm down to
20 nm. The cell precursors are then processed as described above
therefore to current losses.

contacts
From Raman spectrum reported in Figure 3, it is clear that before high
temperature annealing at 950[]C, silicon is deposited in an amorphous
state (black curve). After high temperature annealing (red curve), the
crystallinity fraction increases up to 90%.

across the SiO2/poly-Si structure for the case of 75-nm-thick poly-Si
implanted with fixed dose of 10[16] ions/cm[2] and annealed at 950[]C
for 5 minutes and 850[]C for 90 minutes, respectively. The sample
annealed at 950[]C (green curve in Figure 4) confines 10[20] P atoms
into poly-Si layer, and a similar amount is diffused into c-Si bulk. For
the case of 850[]C (red curve in Figure 4), the junction depth is
shallower with approximately 10[20] P atoms confined into the poly-Si
layer. The doping profile decreases with a sharp tail into the c-Si with
10[18] atoms near the c-Si/SiO2 interface. This doping diffusion into
c-Si bulk facilitates carrier transport across the junction[60,61]
Consequently, different doping profiles lead to a different passivation
properties thanks to the higher Auger recombination contribution that
is estimated to be 40% higher in case of 950[]C annealed sample. We
measure τeff = 0.8 ms and τeff = 2.2 ms for the sample annealed at
950[]C and 850[]C, respectively. The difference in passivation perfor
mance is due to different distribution of dopants inside crystalline sili
con at the interface with tunneling oxide. Indeed, the electrical field
across the junction depends on spatial variation of potential energy by
incorporating dopant species. In case of constant doping before/after
the interface with tunneling oxide, the electrical field is negligible,
explaining the lack of field-effect passivation in case of sample
annealed 950[]C (see Figure 4).

structure reported in Figure 1A. The poly-Si layer thickness is kept
constant at 250 nm for the three samples fabricated while the P
implantation is performed at an energy of 10 keV. Sample n1 receives
a dose of 7.510[15] ions/cm[2], while for samples n2 and n3, implantation
dose is 10[16] ions/cm[2]. All the samples undergo the same annealing
process for 5 minutes at temperature of 950[]C, and the FGA is tested
only for sample n3. Surface passivation quality of the fabricated sam
ples is reported in the same Table 1. Sample n1, implanted at lower
dose, exhibits relatively low performance with τeff = 0.8 ms, J0 =
72 fA/cm[2], and iVOC = 664 mV. When implantation dose is increased
up to 110[16] ions/cm[2] (sample n2), lifetime increases up to 1.8 milli
seconds, and J0 decreases to 39 fA/cm[2] with improved iVOC up to
688 mV. The better passivation properties observed for increased
implantation dose can be explained by the higher doping concentra
tion into poly-Si layer that enhances carrier selectivity inducing a
stronger electrical field across the junction.[53] A similar trend has been
observed in literature by other researchers.[14,54,55] Finally, we test the
effect of FGA on the investigated stack (sample n3), measuring a sig
nificant improvement in the passivation properties. In particular, we
measured τeff = 4.6 ms, J0 = 14.5 fA/cm[2], and iVOC > 700 mV. Sample
n3 benefits from the FGA treatment owing to the diffusion of H[+]
atoms into the stack, enhancing chemical passivation at the c-Si/SiO2
interface.[42,56] Similar results about FGA have been reported in Peibst
et al,[57] although in our case, the implantation dose is higher than typi
cal literature values[58,59] with similar annealing conditions.
After the optimal temperature is found, we optimize the doping
level for the 75-nm-thick n-type poly-Si by sweeping implantation

dose in the range from 0.510[16] ions/cm[2] to 1.210[16] ions/cm[2].
Annealing temperature is kept at 850[]C for 90 minutes. The
corresponding carrier lifetime curves versus minority carrier density
are reported in Figure 5. The layer implanted with a dose of 510[15]
ions/cm[2] exhibited the lowest τeff (0.5 ms), with a poor behavior at
low injection level. By increasing the dose up to 7.510[15] and 110[16]
ions/cm[2], the lifetime curves shift up in the entire injection level with
a τeff ~ 2 ms. Further increasing the dose up to 1.210[16] ions/cm[2], τeff
degrades down to 0.5 milliseconds with a severe effect on the surface
passivation (iVoc = 663 mV). In these cases, sheet resistance is varying
from 310 Ω/sq (D = 510[15] cm[2]) to 200 Ω/sq (D = 10[16] cm[2]). As for
the case of 250-nm-thick poly-Si, implantation dose lower than 10[16]
ions/cm[2] does not induce such strong electric field across the junction
to increase carrier-selectivity. On the other hand, a dose higher than
10[16] ions/cm[2] induces lower lifetime. This is because the resulting
junction is Auger-limited with a J0 = 95 fA/cm[2], according to a qualita
tive simulation run by EDNA 2.[62] The optimum for 75-nm-thick poly
Si layer is found indeed for a dose of 110[16] ions/cm[2]. In this case, J0
= 14 fA/cm[2] and iVOC = 703 mV indicate a trade-off between optimal
surface vs Auger recombination mechanisms.
while measuring a fairly constant J0 = 14.5 fA/cm[2], independently
from the poly-Si thickness. This means that the chemical passivation
is excellent in all the three samples. A similar trend has been observed
in literature.[33,63]
A similar study is performed on B-implanted poly-Si CSPC on flat
substrate. Table 2 shows τeff, J0, and iVOC in as-annealed condition
and after FGA treatment for the case of 250-nm-thick poly-Si layer.
The samples are implanted with 5 keV as ion energy and a dose of
510[15] ions/cm[2]. Annealing is at temperature of 950[]C and time is
5 minutes.
For sample p1, after annealing for dopants activation and crystalli
zation, we measure τeff = 3.8 ms, J0 = 19 fA/cm[2], and iVOC = 704 mV.
For sample p2, which subsequently received also FGA, it is evident
that hydrogenation treatment via FGA is capable of increasing lifetime
by 25% relative with respect to p1 with τeff = 5.2 ms and J0 = 12.5
fA/cm[2]. Furthermore, iVOC increases by more than 10 mV, up to
716 mV. As in case of the electron-selective contact, we investigate
the effect of thinning the p-type poly-Si layer on passivation proper
ties. When the p-type poly-Si layer is 75 nm thick, an annealing at
950[]C is not suitable to perfectly confine the boron doping into poly
Si layer. For this reason, annealing temperature is scaled down to
850[]C and time is increased to 90 minutes. As for n-type poly-Si
layers, a series of different implantation doses from 510[15] to 10[16]
ions/cm[2] is performed.
Figure 7 shows QSSPC lifetime curves of symmetric samples pas
Figure 6A shows optimal doping profile for 250-, 75-, and 35-nm
thick poly-Si layers and their corresponding τeff and J0. For the
35-nm-thick poly-Si layer, we obtain a sharp doping profile for an
annealing performed at 850[]C for 45 minutes. We obtain a not fully
optimized 75-nm-thick layer because its doping profile (shown in
Figure 6A), albeit decaying as steeply as the other two cases into c-Si
bulk, does not keep high concentration as close as possible to the
poly-Si/SiO2 interface. Therefore, a less effective field-effect passiv
ation is in place for this sample. Consequently, both 250- and 35-nm
thick poly-Si layers exhibit τeff above 4.5 milliseconds, while the
75-nm-thick one is limited at 2.3 milliseconds. Sheet resistance of
35-nm-thick poly-Si layer is 270 Ω/sq. The three samples depicted in
Figure 6A have approximately 10[20] phosphorous atoms/cm[3] into the
poly-Si layer, while the doping tail in the c-Si bulk becomes not signifi
cant after about 100 nm. Figure 6B summarizes these τeff results
sivated by SiO2/p-type poly-Si stack with different implantation doses
and ion energy = 5 keV. By increasing implantation dose, the curves
shift towards higher carrier lifetimes. The highest passivation quality
is measured for 10[16] ions/cm[2] with τeff = 2.3 ms, J0 = 23 fA/cm[2], and
iVOC = 691 mV. In this case, sheet resistance is 285 Ω/sq. For lower
doses, as the doping level into poly-Si is not optimal, lifetime is limited
at approximately 1 millisecond.
Figure 8A shows doping profiles of 250-, 75-, and 35-nm-thick
p-type poly-Si samples. In the case of 250-nm-thick layer, 10[20] B
atoms/cm[3] are confined well into the poly-Si layer and its doping tail
in c-Si bulk, ensuring τeff > 5 ms. For the 75-nm-thick sample
(see Figure 8A, red line), the doping level into poly-Si is around
approximately 310[20] B atoms/cm[3], and it decreases in c-Si bulk such
that after 100 nm in c-Si bulk, there are 10[18] B atoms/cm[3], giving a
weaker field-effect passivation (τeff = 2.3 ms) than the case of
250-nm-thick poly-Si. When 35-nm-thick poly-Si is deposited, the
B-doping concentration at c-Si/SiO2/poly-Si junction is on the order
of 10[20] cm[−][3] on both sides of the SiO2 tunneling layer, causing almost
no field-effect passivation, and therefore, lifetime is 0.5 milliseconds.
In this case, sheet resistance is 263 Ω/sq. In this case, also Auger
recombination plays a role in the recombination processes. Since
boron is a light atom (atomic mass unit of 11), its diffusivity into silicon
is greater than that of phosphorous[64]; therefore, having already lim
ited the annealing temperature to 850[]C to prevent unwanted diffu
sion of boron into the c-Si bulk, the annealing time could be reduced
further. On the other hand, boron typically needs higher activation
temperatures than phosphorous,[64] thus narrowing the optimization
window of B-implanted poly-Si In the two thicker layers junction

is higher than the one used for 250-nm-thick layer. This might be cau
sed by a more complicated incorporation of B dopants into thinner
poly-Si layers. A possible way to minimize junction depth is to use
lower implantation energy,[65] which is unfortunately not possible in
our setup. Figure 8B summarizes all the results obtained so far about
p-type poly-Si passivating contact for different thicknesses. It shows
that τeff increases when poly-Si thickness increases with an opposite
trend for J0. For the 35-nm-thick B-doped poly-Si layer, low lifetime
of 0.5 milliseconds, iVOC of 655 mV, and J0 ~ 100 fA/cm[2] are
obtained, indicating overall that also chemical passivation is affected,
most likely by inactive clusters of B atoms acting as recombination
centers. For both hole-selective and electron-selective contacts,
annealing temperature is higher when the poly-Si thickness is in the
range of 250 nm. This is also partially confirmed in Yan et al[66],where a
BBr3 diffusion instead of ion implantation is used as ex situ doping
technique. Finally, also for our hole-selective poly-Si contacts, implan
tation doses are much higher than the state of the art.[67],We believe
that this might be due to different density of the poly-Si layers.

depths are optimized such that doping unbalance at the junction is
high enough to induce strong electrical field, while in the 35-nm-thick
case, diffusion of dopants is rather high causing weak electrical field
at the junction and also high Auger recombination. Furthermore, we
observe that the optimized implantation dose for thinner poly-Si layer

n-type and p-type poly-Si contacts, respectively. Figure 9A reports in
the top panel the measured phosphorous doping concentration pro
files and in the bottom panel the corresponding conduction energy
level together with the Fermi energy level in equilibrium of n-type
poly-Si/SiO2/c-Si junction simulated for different poly-Si thicknesses.
For n-type contact, a strong band bending is observed for the 250
and 35-nm-thick samples, revealing a stronger field-effect passivation
than that related to the 75-nm-thick sample. This is compatible with
the measured lifetime achieved by n-type poly-Si (see Figure 6B). In
particular, strong electrical field across the junction is induced by high
electron density at the interface. This has the effect to place the con
duction band energy level below the Fermi level in c-Si. This mecha
nism is the effect of the optimized doping profile across the junction.
This effect, together with high doping level at poly-Si side, leads to a
band alignment which is crucial for transport through tunneling
oxide.[51] In the case of 75 nm (red curves in Figure 8A), the conduction
band is above the Fermi level. This leads a relatively weak electrical
field across the junction and less efficient tunneling. It is important to
highlight that, in c-Si bulk, high doping profile potentially boosts trans
port through tunneling oxide, but also increases Auger recombination.
Therefore, the doping tail in c-Si bulk should be kept such sharp to
obtain the effect of higher electron accumulation only at c-Si/SiO2
interface.
A similar analysis has been carried out regarding the p-type poly
We can conclude that an ideal doping profile should have high
doping concentration at c-Si/SiO2 interface to enhance collection of
carriers, but at the same time, it should have a relatively shallow dop
ing tail such that Auger recombination is minimized. Accordingly,
reduced layer thickness in both electron and hole-selective contact
requires a careful tuning of implantation dose, annealing temperature
and time to confine the dopants atoms into poly-Si layer, leaving a
sufficiently high doping tail that results in better passivation quality.
3.2 | Solar cells
The optimized carrier-selective contacts discussed in Section 3.1 are
integrated into poly-poly solar cells. We combine the n-type and
p-type poly-Si layers with different thicknesses at the front and rear
side of the device, respectively.
Table 3 summarizes the different poly-poly solar cells fabricated
and the external parameters of the devices. SC1 with 250-nm-thick
poly-Si on both front and rear sides exhibits VOC = 684 mV, JSC =
32 mA/cm[2], and FF = 68.7%. As this cell has not received the FGA
treatment, it appears to be limited by the n-type poly-Si. In fact, its
VOC is in line with the iVOCs values shown in Table 1 for sample n2
(iVOCn,poly,250nm = 688 mV before FGA), which was used for this
device. FF lies below 70%, most likely because lateral transport is
mostly supported by the large doping tail in c-Si at the front electron
contact. Also, the lack of a TCO as transport layer plays an important
role in FF values. In a similar solar cell architecture[29] with a 200-nm
thick poly-Si, VOC was found 10 mV lower than ours and FF 4% abso
lute higher than ours. Those parameters were obtained by screen
printed front contacts that introduce higher recombination but also
ensure lower contact resistivity than our PVD-evaporated contacts. In
our case, contact resistivity of poly-Si layer with Al contacts, mea
sured via transfer length method (TLM), is 0.1 mΩcm[2]. This relatively
low value does not have impact on series resistance of our devices.
By decreasing front and rear poly-Si thicknesses to 75 nm (SC2 in
Table 2), VOC decreases to 663 mV, but FF goes up to 72.8%. This
result is also obtained without FGA treatment. When 35-nm-thick
poly-Si is employed (SC3 in Table 2), we measure an improved VOC up
to 675 mV with a gain of 12 mV as compared with SC2. This improve
ment in VOC is due to the FGA treatment, as demonstrated in the case
of passivation tests of both electron- and hole-selective contacts.
Si contact. Figure 9B shows in the top panel the measured doping
profile and in the bottom panel the corresponding valence energy
level together with the Fermi energy level in equilibrium of p-type
poly-Si/SiO2/c-Si junction simulated for different poly-Si thicknesses.
In this case, the doping profiles of 250- and 75-nm-thick cases induce
a strong valence band bending and, therefore, a strong electrical field.
Similarly, the valence bands of poly-Si and c-Si exhibit an alignment
above the Fermi energy level, for which tunneling is expected to be
efficient for all the samples. However, the depth of the doping profile
tail inside c-Si limits the passivation as Auger recombination is higher
for deeper doping profiles. Accordingly, 250-, 75-, and 35-nm-thick
poly-Si samples exhibit doping profiles as deep as 100 nm, 250 nm,
and 300 nm inside c-Si, respectively. The passivation quality observed
in Figure 8B highlights the effect of Auger recombination on the pas
sivation in terms of τeff and J0. Therefore, in our experimental frame
work, the 250-nm-thick poly-Si sample exhibits the best potential for
p-type poly-Si contact in solar cells.

aTi-seeded Cu-plated front contacts.
Accordingly, we highlight that FGA treatment is critical to improve
both passivation and transport properties of this type of selective
contacts. In this case, FF is reduced to 71%. We speculate that this FF
reduction is due to a different lateral transport through the front con
tact owing to different doping profile in poly-Si layers. Short circuit
current density is very poor for SC1 (32 mA/cm[2]). We measure an
improvement of approximately 4 mA/cm[2] when 75-nm-thick poly-Si
layers are employed. Further improvement up to 36.5 mA/cm[2] is
observed in case of SC3. When front and rear thicknesses are
decoupled to 35 nm at the front and 250 nm at the back (SC4), VOC is
701 mV (the gain is 17 mV compared to SC1), short current density is
35.1 mA/cm[2], and FF is again at 72.8 %, as in SC2. The lower current
might be due to not optimized texturing and anti-reflection coating
thickness. By further thinning the front poly-Si to approximately
20 nm and keeping the rear side poly-Si thickness to 250 nm (SC5),
VOC slightly decreases to 689 mV with respect to SC4, but an increase
in JSC is noted up to 36.5 mA/cm[2] and FF is equal to 73% (ηactive =
19.3%). Finally, the same solar cell as SC5 has been fabricated with Ti
seeded Cu-plated front contacts (SC6), resulting in FF = 75.2%
(approximately 2% absolute higher than SC5) and VOC = 682 mV
(7 mV lower compared with SC5). JSC is 36.3 mA/cm[2], which is slightly
lower than SC5. The overall ηactive is 19.6%. The gain in FF is due to
more conductive Ti/Cu stack respect to the previously used 2-μm
thick e-beam evaporated Al.[68] The reduction in VOC of 7 mV might be
explained by the so-called background-plating[69] that consists in Cu
growing outside the designed fingers areas and acting as deep impu
rity in Si.[70]

parasitic absorption in the long wavelength range between 1000 nm
and 1200 nm,[33,34] which, together with the additional parasitic
absorption due to the rear metal contact, contributes to current
losses. From these experiments, we can demonstrate that the front
poly-Si layer should primarily be kept as thin as possible in order to
limit parasitic absorption.
We performed opto-electrical simulations of the abovementioned
SC1, SC2, and SC3 devices with TCAD Sentaurus[47,51] using
experimentally-extracted optical properties of poly-Si layers.[52]
Figure 11A shows the simulated absorptance in front and rear poly-Si
layers. The device with 250-nm-thick poly-Si layers shows a consis
tent absorption of the incoming light that peaks up to 0.8 in the short
wavelength range and decays to a negligible value at around 800 nm.
When the thickness of poly-Si layers is reduced to 75 nm and 35 nm,
the absorption strongly decreases in the ultraviolet and visible parts
of the spectrum but still peaks to values close to 0.6. For the rear
poly-Si layer, we observe a weak dependence of absorption against
poly-Si thickness. It is noteworthy to mention that our simulations
take into consideration both front texturing[48] and free carrier absorp
tion into poly-Si given by high doping. By integrating these absorption
profiles with the AM1.5 photon flux,[71] we obtain the equivalent pho
tocurrent density losses (JL) for different poly-poly solar cell configura
tions. The values are shown in Figure 11B, where we observe a strong
dependence of front poly-Si thickness on photocurrent density losses
(J ~ 8 5 mA/cm[2] for SC1 configuration) If the front poly-Si layer is
Figure 10 reports the EQE spectra of SC1, SC2, and SC3, clearly
showing the losses in the short-wavelength part of the spectrum due
to parasitic absorption in the front poly-Si layer. SC2 and SC3 devices
show higher current collection than SC1, because of the reduced para
sitic absorption in the front poly-Si layer. In this respect, there is a
substantial improvement in collection from 380 to 800 nm. Further
more, maximum EQE reached is approximately 90% in both SC1 and
SC2. This can be explained by electrical recombination occurring at
the front and rear Si surfaces since no FGA treatment is performed. In
case of SC3, instead, we observe an improved carrier collection across
the whole spectral range up to approximately 97%. This is not only
due to thinner poly-Si layers but also owing to the FGA treatment.
Regardless the poly-Si layers thickness these layers suffer from

kept at 35 nm, JL decreases to approximately 2.5 mA/cm[2]. Regarding
absorption in the rear poly-Si, we obtain JL < 1 mA/cm[2] with a weak
dependency on the backside layer thickness. Therefore, in order to
reach, on one hand, relatively high short circuit current density and,
on the other hand, high VOC (see Figure 8), it is necessary to decouple
the front thickness from the rear one. Focusing on the rear side only,
Figure 12 describes the JL of rear poly-Si and rear metal in the
abovementioned cell configurations. Losses due to metal absorption
are limited between 0.4 and 0.5 mA/cm[2], while the losses into rear
poly-Si account for less than 0.25 mA/cm[2]. By adding those two
losses, the total rear losses differ by only about 0.15 mA/cm[2]
between the configurations 35 nm/35 nm and 35 nm/250
nm. Therefore, we justify the decoupling of front/rear poly-Si
Figure 13 shows the simulated and the measured external param
eters of the first four solar cells indicated in Table 3. The simulation
replicates the same conditions as the fabricated solar cells (SiNx anti
reflection coating, 5% coverage metal grid at the front side, Ag/Cr/Al
stack at the rear side). In some cases, measured JSC overcomes simu
lated one (see Figure 13 top-left panel), as a not-optimal calibration of
the model might underestimate the JSC. Regarding VOC (bottom left
graph in Figure 13), measured values are significantly lower than the
simulated ones. In the case of SC1 and SC2, ideal VOC is around
710 mV, for SC3 VOC ~ 695 mV while for SC4 VOC ~ 720 mV. This
confirms our claim of a weak passivation of the 35-nm-thick p-type
poly-Si layer due to its not optimal doping distribution. Indeed, when
we switch from SC3 to SC4, simulated VOC increases of approximately
30 mV. Regarding FF (top-right panel in Figure 13), values of our fabri
cated solar cells are behind the ideal values. All the simulated values
are above 80%, while measured ones are between 68% and 73%. We
ascribe this major difference to high sheet resistance of poly-Si layers
together with the lack of a TCO layer. Moreover, the use of (e-beam)
evaporation for realizing the metallization as well as the not-optimal
thickness of deposited metals also contribute to FF losses. At the end,
the ultimate efficiencies (Figure 13 bottom-right panel) are estimated
thicknesses.
Based on these results, we performed a TCAD simulation of SC1,
SC2, SC3, and SC4 solar cells to predict their ultimate efficiencies. The
purpose of these simulations is to have an idea of the pitfalls of our
fabricated poly-poly solar cells. It is also important to note that these
simulations are not optimally calibrated, since they represent a quali
tative indication of the routes to pursue to achieve higher efficiencies
with these devices.
to increase from 17.7% (SC1) to 21.7% (SC4).
Finally, we also simulated SC5 to recognize its ultimate efficiency.
We performed this simulation in two different cases: (a) front electron
selective contact with an ideal doping profile taken from Procel et al[51]
and rear hole-selective contact with the measured doping profile
(see Figure 8) and (b) both front and rear poly-Si contacts with ideal
doping profiles shown in Procel et al.[51]
Table 4 highlights the external parameters of such simulated solar
cells. In the case of front-ideal and rear-measured doping distributions
(SC5-1), VOC is expected to be equal to 723 mV, JSC to 38.3 mA/cm[2],
and FF to 80.3%. The simulated efficiency is thus 22.3%. By
employing an ideal doping profile also at rear (SC5-2), the JSC stays at
the same level as for SC5-1, VOC improves by 2 mV, but most impor
tantly, FF increases by 1.5% absolute. This improvement in FF is
ascribed to an optimal hole transport at the rear side due to the
steeper doping distribution across the junction compared to SC5-1,
which allows an improved hole accumulation at c-Si/SiOx interface
for enhancing the tunneling current. The ideal efficiency is therefore
22 7% In perspective these results are important to understand what

to improve in our fabricated solar cells. Indeed, FF losses are the main
limiting factor of efficiency of our TCO-free poly-poly solar cells. To
tackle these losses, the outlook is to (a) optimize front metal grid,
(b) lower series resistance by enhancing lateral transport with in
diffusion in c-Si bulk,[72] (c) realize an efficient metallization scheme
(this has already, partially, been demonstrated by Cu-plating), and
(d) develop rear edge-isolation of poly-Si layer to decrease edge
effects on the solar cell operation. Moreover, also, VOC of our solar
cells is affected by non-ideal doping profile. In Procel et al,[51] it is
shown how a semi-squared doping profile across c-Si/SiO2/poly-Si
junction leads to optimal selectivity. In an expansion of this work, this
ideal doping profile (used for simulations shown in Table 4) can be
achieved by in situ doped epitaxially grown layers, LPCVD or PE-CVD
techniques. It is noteworthy to mention that recently, reported
poly-poly cells based on the PECVD route show VOC beyond 720 mV
and FF very close to 80%.[73] However, from such experimental results
as well as our simulations, it is possible to recognize that the limit of
these solar cells is the JSC that, even for front poly-Si thickness of
20 nm, does not overcome approximately 38 mA/cm[2]. This is due to
strong parasitic absorption at the front poly-Si layer. To avoid these
losses, there are several different solutions. The first one is to reduce
front poly-Si thickness to dpoly < 10 nm. At that point, a TCO transport
layer will be necessary to ensure good fill-factor.[74-76] Another possi
ble solution is to change the front side structure with either amor
phous silicon or a lightly doped homojunction front surface field with
poly-Si passivating contacts only underneath the contacts. Figure 14
shows the EQE of SC3, a hybrid solar cell from,[39] and a PeRFeCT solar
cell from [27] With both the hybrid and the PeRFeCT architectures

losses in the blue part of the spectrum can be mitigated. The poor res
ponsivity at the short-wavelength of our poly-poly cell is much less
problematic if such architecture is deployed in a tandem configuration
together with a thin-film top cell such as perovskite,[29] either in a
monolithic configuration or in a four-terminal configuration.[77]
4 | CONCLUSION
In this paper, we optimize poly-Si layers as carrier-selective passiv
ating contacts prepared by LPCVD and boron- or phosphorous

doped via ion implantation. With the aim to reduce parasitic
absorption in the poly-Si layers, their thickness is drastically
reduced from 250 to 35 nm, and both passivation quality and junc
tion profile are investigated on symmetric samples by varying ion
dose and annealing treatment (ie, temperature/time). For SiO2/n
type poly-Si fabricated on textured c-Si wafers, we obtain J0 <
15 fA/cm[2] regardless the deposited poly-Si thickness. For these
samples, carrier lifetimes above 4 milliseconds are measured for
both the thickest and thinnest investigated poly-Si layers. On the
contrary, 75-nm-thick layer exhibits τeff ~ 2 ms, due to not
optimized doping profile that leads to a degraded field-effect pas
sivation. ECV measurements confirm this hypothesis indicating, for
an acceptable passivation quality, a shallow junction depth into c-Si
bulk and 10[20] P atoms/cm[3] confined into poly-Si layer for the
250-nm and 35-nm-thick samples. Regarding the SiO2/p-type poly
Si, passivation quality increases with poly-Si thickness. This result is
the consequence of an easier doping confinement in 250-nm-thick
poly-Si. Although we changed implantation dose and annealing
temperature/time, doping profile has a wide junction depth when
thinner poly-Si is employed, leading to weaker field-effect
passivation.
efficiency of our solar cells is mainly limited by FF losses coming
from various sources: (a) not-optimized front metal grid, (b) series
resistance given by poor lateral transport due the small in-diffusion
in c-Si bulk, (c) thin metallization scheme, and (d) no rear edge
isolation of poly-Si structure. With all these adjustments, we fore
cast efficiencies greater than 21% in single junction configuration.
It is remarkable that processing of this solar cell consists in only
four steps, and therefore, it is suitable for industrial up taking with
further engineering. The authors believe that this solar cell archi
tecture is a good candidate for a bottom cell in tandem configura
tion with emerging technologies such as perovskite. Indeed, given
its high thermal budget and the poor responsivity in the blue part
of the spectrum, it matches all the requirements for a fabrication
of both two and four terminal tandem devices.

We evaluated the effect of doping profile on field-effect pas
sivation and band alignment on the basis of TCAD simulations.
Accordingly, the experimentally optimized doping profile maximizes
the trade-off between electrical field and Auger recombination by
means of high doping concentration at c-Si surface and thinner
buried doping profile inside c-Si, concurrently. The optimized p
and n-type SiO2/poly-Si contacts are tested in completed TCO-free
FBC poly-poly solar cells with SiNx as anti-reflection coating. It is
important to remark that the fabrication process is lean, such that
it has only four steps. By decreasing front/rear poly-Si thicknesses,
as expected, more incoming light can reach the c-Si without being
parasitically absorbed in the front stack. We measure a gain in JSC
up to 4 mA/cm[2] when switching from 250- to 35-nm-thick front
poly-Si. Moreover, we have shown that most of the optical losses
are in the short-wavelength range. In fact, according to TCAD sim
ulations, equivalent photo current density losses are highly depen
dent on front poly-Si thickness, while the equivalent photocurrent
density lost at the rear side in the long-wavelength range is only
0.15 mA/cm[2] when switching the rear side poly-Si thickness from
250 to 35 nm. Therefore, we decouple the front/rear poly-Si thick
nesses, keeping the p-type on the rear side at 250 nm and thinning
the film on the front down to 35 nm to concurrently optimize
transparency of the front film and p-type passivation at rear. This
cell (SC4) exhibits a VOC of 701 mV with a gain of 17 mV as com
pared with the device with thicker p-type poly-Si (SC1). Further
decrease in the front n-poly-Si layer down to 20 nm leads to a
trade-off between VOC (decreased to 689 mV) and JSC (increased
to approximately 36 mA/cm[2]). Finally, using Ti-Cu plated front con
tacts, FF increases up to 75.2% while VOC decreases to 682 mV,
ascribed to background plating outside the designated grid area. A
TCAD simulation of our poly-poly solar cells shows that the
