The presence of excess hydrogen at the interface between a
metal substrate and a protective oxide can cause blistering[1–3]
and spallation of the scale[4–8]. However, it remains unclear
how nanoscale bubbles manage to reach the critical size in
the first place. Here, we perform in situ environmental trans-
mission electron microscopy experiments of the aluminium
metal/oxide interface under hydrogen exposure. It is found
that once the interface is weakened by hydrogen segregation,
surface difusion of Al atoms initiates the formation of faceted
cavities on the metal side, driven by Wulf reconstruction.
The morphology and growth rate of these cavities are highly
sensitive to the crystallographic orientation of the aluminium
substrate. Once the cavities grow to a critical size, the internal

Our findings have implications for understanding hydrogen
damage of interfaces.
Hydrogen-induced interfacial failure, such as blistering at the
metal (M)/oxide (MO) interface and protective scale spallation, is
well known to plague native oxides and coatings on metals and
alloys. In gas turbines[3,6–8], nuclear power plants[9–11], humid environments[1,12], or even solar sails[13], such hydrogen-related damage can
be severe. It is generally believed that gross interfacial failure begins
by the growth of a nanoscale gas bubble[14,15], driven by the internal
gas pressure P, that plastically deforms the capping oxide layer to
cause a visible outward blister (with radius of curvature, R). Existing
models[14,16–18] pitch P against the yield strength σY, of the MO layer,
and its surface energy γ . One can then derive a critical blister radius
RC that depends on P, with the following relationship defining when
blistering can occur:
P − [4]3[σ]R[Y][2]C[t][ 2] − [2]R[γ]C > 0 (1)
where t is the MO layer thickness. However, after inserting reasonable material parameters into equation (1) (see Supplementary
Information) for Al/Al2O3, the following problem is noted. For P
values of a few hundred megapascals (same order as the bulk yield
strength of Al), RC is of the order of tens of nanometres. But if so, how
does a ‘subcritical’ (R < RC) gas bubble grow? Calculations show that
the thermal fluctuation energy kBT cannot propel R to RC within
the experimental timescale. If one uses an unrealistically high gas
pressure P of tens of gigapascals (even higher than the ideal strength
of Al), RC can still only be reduced to a few nanometres. In other
words, existing theories, although explaining MO blistering at above
tens of nanometres, seem to leave a gap below tens of nanometres,
where M deformation seems inevitable.
This gap in understanding can be filled by recognizing that
the metal surface morphology can change in the presence of free
surface diffusion, which has been recently shown to be an important
deformation mechanism of metals at sub-10-nm scale even at room
temperature[19,20]. This speculation is strengthened by the realization
that the metal configuration near M/MO is likely to be a metastable,
kinetically trapped structure, usually not optimal for M itself in
terms of its surface energies. However, if hydrogen atoms segregate
to the M/MO interface and sever M–O bonds[21–23], the M atoms
freed from MO can diffuse more quickly towards the desired shape,
dictated by M’s Wulff construction, at least at the nanoscale. This
provides an additional thermodynamic driving force unaccounted
for in equation (1), which is concerned with only oxide properties,
as well as a kinetic pathway to achieve RC because metal surface
diffusion is very efficacious at changing morphology at small length
scales (rate ∝ r [−][3]; ref. 20). The postulated pathway is illustrated in
Fig. 1. When an interface is weakened by the interface-segregating
hydrogen atoms (Fig. 1a), surface diffusion of metal atoms becomes
readily activated, to reshape the metal surface: the M atoms
diffuse away along the M/MO interface to evolve the exposed M
surface towards that predicted by the Wulff construction. Once the
inwardly growing cavity (Fig. 1b) reaches a critical size, the trapped
gas pressure will be sufficient to mechanically push the oxide layer
outward. This permits the ensuing oxide blistering (Fig. 1c) that
expands outward, causing eventual oxide spallation.
To directly observe how the cavity emerges initially underneath
the oxide layer, here we have monitored the hydrogenation process
of single-crystalline aluminium pillars with a thin layer of native
oxide, in a 2 Pa H2 gas environment at room temperature, inside an
environmental transmission electron microscope (TEM). Figure 2
shows the bright-field TEM images of a pillar 240 nm in diameter,
before and after hydrogen exposure. Two main changes can be
clearly observed after exposure to hydrogen: the originally smooth
thickness contours and metal/oxide interface have become wavy;
blisters form at geometrical edges (red arrows in Fig. 2b). For
comparison, in situ TEM experiments were also conducted in
vacuum and with a pure nitrogen gas environment, which showed
no such changes in the pillar under similar electron-beam intensity
and exposure time, indicating that hydrogen exposure is responsible
for the observed blistering and roughening. The main effect of the
electron beam in our experiments is to ionize the H2, generating
high fugacity to facilitate hydrogen entrance[17].
Figure 3 reveals how the cavities nucleate at the metal/oxide interface. As seen in Fig. 3a, the initial interface is straight and smooth,
and so are the thickness contours inside the pillar. As exposure to

hydrogen continues, small perturbations appear and grow to assume
well-shaped cavities, which bow towards the metal side (see Fig. 3b
and Supplementary Movie 1). The base widths w of these ‘wells’
range from a few nanometres to about 25 nm, and their spatial
arrangement shows some degree of periodicity along the interface.
The average cavity size characterized by ¯w increases with time, and
each individual cavity continuously changes its size and shape (see
Supplementary Movies 1 and 2). Also, we observed cavity coarsening; that is, big cavities consume the small ones (see Supplementary Fig. 1). This evolution of nanocavities changes the thickness
gradient in the near-interface region, giving rise to wavy thickness
contours. As dislocation activity is not observed, the formation of
the cavity at the oxide/metal interface is made possible by diffusional
deformation of the metal surface. The surface diffusion is facile,
because when hydrogen segregates at the interface, the interfacial
atomic bonds are much weakened owing to hydrogen insertion[21–23],
and the activation barrier for diffusion of the near-interface atoms
is lowered because they are no longer directly bonded to the oxide.
The metal surfaces are then able to locally approach the inclinations
dictated by the Wulff construction, due to capillary forces that drive
energy minimization. Consequently, {111} facets, which are known
to have the lowest surface energy in face-centred cubic metals, are
expected to develop. Indeed, as the cavities grow to about w = 20 nm
in size (defined by the largest geometric dimension), their profiles
show clear straight segments, which result from the projections of
{111} facets that comprise the inner cavity surface bordering the Al
underneath (Fig. 3c,d).
The above observations prove that low-gas-pressure cavity

of metal-side Wulff reconstruction, and also enabled by facile
metal-side surface diffusion. In principle, as long as there is enough
hydrogen segregation to debond M–O at the M/MO interface—
a molecular (Ångström)-scale process that promotes freed-metal
surface diffusion—such pre-blister nanoscale cavities can form,
even with P → 0.
Figure 4 depicts a typical process of blister formation at an
edge of the pillar. After metal atoms diffuse away to leave a cavity,
the newly exposed metal surfaces develop crystallographic {111}
facets. Within 25 min of hydrogen exposure, the cavity w grows
bigger as the {111} facets retreat inward, but the oxide layer remains
unyielding (Fig. 4b). At 28 min, when the width of the cavity reaches
44 nm in diameter (Fig. 4c), the oxide begins to undergo large plastic
deformation under the pressure of the accumulated H2 gas, creating
a blister.
Obviously, the cavity has to reach a critical size (wc) before the
onset of plastic deformation of the oxide layer, because it acts as a
pinning constraint on the MO membrane. The initial stage of cavity
emergence described above (not due to high internal hydrogen
pressure) allows the deformation of the oxide layer to start from
a much larger size than those required by traditional pressuredriven models[14,16–18]. Therefore, the singularity problem in those
nucleation models is resolved. Also, this criterion underscores two
directions that may help suppress the unwanted blistering. The first
is to increase Rc by lowering the environmental hydrogen fugacity
(such as lowering the level of moisture). The second is to decrease

slope of S. The surface diffusivity DS can then be estimated using
the following equation:

respectively. This is very close to the prediction from the

The pristine metal surfaces in our experiments are completely
immersed in hydrogen, akin to clean Al with near-intrinsic surface
diffusivity. We can therefore conclude that it is indeed the surface
diffusion of Al that opens up the initial cavity for the blisters to
take shape.
The degree of blistering we observed depends on surface
orientation. Figure 5 shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images of a [110] (its axial direction) pillar, with Fig. 5a,b being
the side view and top view, respectively. The orientations of the
{111} planes (marked red) are shown in Fig. 5b. We observed that
around the pillar circumference the blisters preferentially reside
atop the {111} planes, whereas much smaller blisters are visible on
the {100} planes and no blisters are found on the {110} planes.
In comparison, Fig. 5c shows a pillar in the [100] axial direction,
which has no {111} planes on its cylindrical surface. As a result,
blisters form more randomly all over the cylindrical surface after
prolonged hydrogen exposure. These results (see more evidence
in Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1) indicate
that the surface blistering propensity is orientation dependent
and follows the following ranking order: {111} > {100} > {110},

reducing surface roughness, removing grain boundary/surface
intersections, and engineering the surface orientation; suppressing
surface diffusion, possibly by adding alloying elements into the
base metal.
The retreating {111} facet at the edge of the pillar also gives
us an opportunity to quantitatively estimate the surface diffusivity.
By drawing an analogy to the flattening of a wrinkled surface,
a quantitative model to estimate the surface diffusivity can be
obtained, following the method of refs 24,25. Assuming that the
corner is a single-hump wrinkle, we can adopt the final rest position
of the {111} facet in Fig. 4d as the reference and measure the height
change of the receding facet with time. As plotted in Fig. 4e, the
natural logarithm of height is a linear function of time, giving a

in line with the expectation from their surface energies[28]. This
blistering anisotropy originates from the fact that {111} facets
have the lowest surface energy and are correspondingly the most
prone to cavity nucleation and growth. As already shown in Fig. 4,
the cavity on {111} has the fastest growth rate and reaches wc
the earliest. Figure 5 thus suggests that to delay blistering in the
surface oxide, the metal should avoid low-energy planes parallel to
its surfaces.
We have discovered that long before visible blisters are created,
cavities form beneath the oxide film on hydrogen exposure, driven
by Wulff reconstruction and freed-metal surface diffusion. We
name this phenomenon ‘pre-blister cavitation’, which occurs on the
metal side. Our findings suggest that it takes much less hydrogen
to weaken the interface to allow Wulff reconstruction than to
blister the oxide layer. This has implications for understanding the
integrity/damage of coatings and passivation films on metals, where
hydrogen-induced interfacial failure is a major threat. In particular,
even when the blisters stay subcritical (Fig. 1b) owing to very small
Wulff cavities (say ∼5 nm), these very small Wulff cavities are still
hidden damage that greatly reduces the interfacial delamination
strength, by providing potential nucleation and coalescence sites for
interfacial fracture under external stress. Therefore, blistering is a
final-stage visible symptom of hydrogen damage of the interface, but
not a necessary condition for markedly easier scale spallation from
the substrate[6,29].
