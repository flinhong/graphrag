It shows that \u03c4eff increases when poly-Si thickness increases with an opposite trend for J0. For the 35-nm-thick B-doped poly-Si layer, low lifetime of 0.5 milliseconds, iVOC of 655 mV, and J0 ~ 100 fA/cm[2] are obtained, indicating overall that also chemical passivation is affected, most likely by inactive clusters of B atoms acting as recombination centers. For both hole-selective and electron-selective contacts, annealing temperature is higher when the poly-Si thickness is in the range of 250 nm. This is also partially confirmed in Yan et al[66],where a BBr3 diffusion instead of ion implantation is used as ex situ doping technique. Finally, also for our hole-selective poly-Si contacts, implantation doses are much higher than the state of the art.[67],We believe that this might be due to different density of the poly-Si layers.

This effect, together with high doping level at poly-Si side, leads to a band alignment which is crucial for transport through tunneling oxide.[51] In the case of 75 nm (red curves in Figure 8A), the conduction band is above the Fermi level. This leads a relatively weak electrical field across the junction and less efficient tunneling. It is important to highlight that, in c-Si bulk, high doping profile potentially boosts trans port through tunneling oxide, but also increases Auger recombination. Therefore, the doping tail in c-Si bulk should be kept such sharp to obtain the effect of higher electron accumulation only at c-Si/SiO2 interface.

Accordingly, reduced layer thickness in both electron and hole-selective contact requires a careful tuning of implantation dose, annealing temperature and time to confine the dopants atoms into poly-Si layer, leaving a sufficiently high doping tail that results in better passivation quality. 3.2 | Solar cells The optimized carrier-selective contacts discussed in Section 3.1 are integrated into poly-poly solar cells.

FF lies below 70%, most likely because lateral transport is mostly supported by the large doping tail in c-Si at the front electron contact. Also, the lack of a TCO as transport layer plays an important role in FF values. In a similar solar cell architecture[29] with a 200-nm thick poly-Si, VOC was found 10 mV lower than ours and FF 4% absolute higher than ours. Those parameters were obtained by screen printed front contacts that introduce higher recombination but also ensure lower contact resistivity than our PVD-evaporated contacts.

Similarly, the valence bands of poly-Si and c-Si exhibit an alignment above the Fermi energy level, for which tunneling is expected to be efficient for all the samples. However, the depth of the doping profile tail inside c-Si limits the passivation as Auger recombination is higher for deeper doping profiles. Accordingly, 250-, 75-, and 35-nm-thick poly-Si samples exhibit doping profiles as deep as 100 nm, 250 nm, and 300 nm inside c-Si, respectively.

From these experiments, we can demonstrate that the front poly-Si layer should primarily be kept as thin as possible in order to limit parasitic absorption.

For the rear poly-Si layer, we observe a weak dependence of absorption against poly-Si thickness. It is noteworthy to mention that our simulations take into consideration both front texturing[48] and free carrier absorp tion into poly-Si given by high doping. By integrating these absorption profiles with the AM1.5 photon flux,[71] we obtain the equivalent pho tocurrent density losses (JL) for different poly-poly solar cell configura tions. The values are shown in Figure 11B, where we observe a strong dependence of front poly-Si thickness on photocurrent density losses (J ~ 8 5 mA/cm[2] for SC1 configuration) If the front poly-Si layer is Figure 10 reports the EQE spectra of SC1, SC2, and SC3, clearly showing the losses in the short-wavelength part of", "relationships": [{"source": "device", "relationship": "has", "target": "poly-Si layers"}, {"source": "poly-Si layers", "relationship": "show", "target": "absorption"}, {"source": "absorption", "relationship": "peaks", "target": "0.8"}, {"source": "absorption", "relationship": "decays", "target": "800 nm"}, {"source": "poly-Si layers", "relationship": "reduced", "target": "75 nm"}, {"source": "poly-Si layers", "relationship": "reduced", "target": "35 nm"}, {"source": "absorption", "relationship": "decreases", "target": "ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum"}, {"source": "absorption", "relationship": "peaks", "target": "0.6"}, {"source": "rear poly-Si layer", "relationship": "observe", "target": "weak dependence of absorption"}, {"source": "simulations", "relationship": "take", "target": "front texturing"}, {"source": "simulations", "relationship": "take", "target": "free carrier absorption"}, {"source": "absorption profiles", "relationship": "integrate", "target": "AM1.5 photon flux"}, {"source": "absorption profiles", "relationship": "obtain", "target": "equivalent photocurrent density losses"}, {"source": "front poly-Si thickness", "relationship": "observe", "target": "strong dependence of photocurrent density losses"}, {"source": "SC1 configuration", "relationship": "has", "target": "photocurrent density losses"}, {"source": "Figure 10", "relationship": "reports", "target": "EQE spectra"}, {"source": "EQE spectra", "relationship": "show", "target": "losses in the short-wavelength part"}]}, {"text_chunk": "Figure 11B, where we observe a strong dependence of front poly-Si thickness on photocurrent density losses (J ~ 8 5 mA/cm[2] for SC1 configuration) If the front poly-Si layer is Figure 10 reports the EQE spectra of SC1, SC2, and SC3, clearly showing the losses in the short-wavelength part of the spectrum due to parasitic absorption in the front poly-Si layer. SC2 and SC3 devices show higher current collection than SC1, because of the reduced parasitic absorption in the front poly-Si layer. In this respect, there is a substantial improvement in collection from 380 to 800 nm. Further more, maximum EQE reached is approximately 90% in both SC1 and SC2. This can be explained by electrical recombination occurring at the front and rear Si surfaces since no FGA treatment is performed. In case of SC3, instead, we observe an improved carrier collection across the whole spectral range up to approximately 97%. This is not only due to thinner poly-Si layers but also owing to the FGA treatment.

Accordingly, the experimentally optimized doping profile maximizes the trade-off between electrical field and Auger recombination by means of high doping concentration at c-Si surface and thinner buried doping profile inside c-Si, concurrently. The optimized p and n-type SiO2/poly-Si contacts are tested in completed TCO-free FBC poly-poly solar cells with SiNx as anti-reflection coating. It is important to remark that the fabrication process is lean, such that it has only four steps. By decreasing front/rear poly-Si thicknesses, as expected, more incoming light can reach the c-Si without being parasitically absorbed in the front stack. We measure a gain in JSC up to 4 mA/cm[2] when switching from 250- to 35-nm-thick front poly-Si. Moreover, we have shown that most of the optical losses are in the short-wavelength range. In fact, according to TCAD sim ulations, equivalent photo current density losses are highly depen dent on front poly-Si thickness, while the equivalent photocurrent density lost at the rear side in the long-wavelength range is only 0.15 mA/cm[2] when switching the rear side poly-Si thickness from 250 to 35 nm.

Therefore, we decouple the front/rear poly-Si thick nesses, keeping the p-type on the rear side at 250 nm and thinning the film on the front down to 35 nm to concurrently optimize transparency of the front film and p-type passivation at rear. This cell (SC4) exhibits a VOC of 701 mV with a gain of 17 mV as com pared with the device with thicker p-type poly-Si (SC1). Further decrease in the front n-poly-Si layer down to 20 nm leads to a trade-off between VOC (decreased to 689 mV) and JSC (increased to approximately 36 mA/cm[2]). Finally, using Ti-Cu plated front con tacts, FF increases up to 75.2% while VOC decreases to 682 mV, ascribed to background plating outside the designated grid area.
