In \u201cmechanisms\u201d, the plural is used to convey the fact that it is a multi-step phenomenon. Because of this complexity, the theoretical work, in comparison, is far less abundant. Hydrogen blistering of silicon is qualitatively understood in broad terms: H being insoluble in Si, it tends to segregate into cavities which grow and coalesce at high temperature, and the H2 pressure in the cavities finally deforms the surface. In fact, our understanding of the microscopic mechanisms has progressed much beyond that level thanks to the sophisticated work that has been carried out using techniques such as transmission electron microscopy, Rutherford backscattering in the channelling mode, infrared spectroscopy of local vibrational modes, stress and strain measurements, and others.

Typical blisters and craters are shown in Fig. 1 [2]. This takes place for ion energies as low as 2 keV [3] and as high as 1 MeV [4]. Under particular conditions, blisters can be produced by plasma hydrogenation as well [5].

From the evidence, it is unlikely that there exists a single, general, microscopic mechanism: this is true not only when H and He blistering are compared [16], but also when H blistering of supposedly similar semiconductors like Si and Ge are compared [7].

Hydrogen can be incorporated at many steps in silicon device processing. Sometimes this happens adventitiously, unwillingly or unknowingly, though this rarely causes the type of damage we will talk about. Other times, hydrogen compounds are used in processing, as in surface conditioning with acids or hydroxides or as in chemical vapour deposition from a precursor like silane: here H introduction may not be the goal but it happens all the same. Finally, it can be injected deliberately by ion implantation or plasma exposure. The way by which H enters Si determines the type and extent of damage.

Finally, it can be injected deliberately by ion implantation or plasma exposure. The way by which H enters Si determines the type and extent of damage. Exposure to molecular H2 at high temperature and pressure results in little measurable damage, although infrared spectroscopy clearly shows hydrogen presence in the lattice [23]. On the other hand, exposure to atomic hydrogen, even from a remote plasma, produces a peculiar type of defect, the {111} platelet, a nanometer size disc-shaped cavity decorated with, and stabilized by, adsorbed hydrogen, and lying in {111} planes [24\u201327]. Finally, if energetic H ions are implanted, an abundance of diverse defects is produced. The ion\u2019s collisions with lattice atoms produce point defects (vacancies, V, and self-interstitials, I) [28, 29]. At room temperature these are mobile in Si, and so are the H atoms that have just been implanted; the three species (V, I, H) migrate until either H reacts with a dangling bond, or V and I annihilate, or V\u2019s or I\u2019s form clusters, or they disappear at sinks including the surface.

Many aspects of these processes have already been clarified as discussed in the cited reviews [18\u201322]. But they are still being studied in earnest, in particular in relation with blistering, but also in connection with other important questions such as defect passivation and dopant inactivation. It must be added that H atoms are very reactive not only with the dangling bonds provided by V\u2019s and I\u2019s, but also with almost any impurity (O, C, metals) and with common dopants (B, P, As, Sb). 1.3 Application of blistering: ion-cutting in microtechnology Silicon blistering was considered a nuisance and attracted only sporadic attention for nearly two decades. Indeed, investigators of H behaviour in Si generally used subthreshold H doses and avoided the complications due to blistering.

The burst of activities that has taken place since the mid-1990\u2019s springs directly from the perspectives opened by Bruel\u2019s invention of ion-cutting [30]. It is not our purpose to discuss in detail this technological use of blistering for silicon-on-insulator (SOI)[1] fabrication: This has been reviewed by Bruel [31] in 1998 and Celler and Cristoloveanu [32] in 2003, and more recent progress was reported at the ECS Symposium on SOI [33]. Ion cutting is in fact a generic process applicable not only to the now commercial fabrication of SOI, but also to the creation of a wide variety of heterostructures composed of semiconductor and/or insulator layers [11]. It is particularly useful whenever atomically sharp and defect-free interfaces between layers are required. Briefly, in its original form [30], the process works as follows: (1) A \u201cdonor\u201d Si wafer \u201cA\u201d is given a thin thermal oxide or else its surface is cleaned and made hydrophilic; (2) wafer A is implanted with a dose of several 10[16] H/cm[2] at a typical energy of tens of keV; (3) a \u201chandle\u201d wafer \u201cB\u201d with a", "relationships": [{"source": "blistering-related work", "relationship": "contributes", "target": "H\u2013Si interactions"}, {"source": "Bruel\u2019s invention of ion-cutting", "relationship": "opens", "target": "perspectives"}, {"source": "ion cutting", "relationship": "applies", "target": "SOI fabrication"}, {"source": "ion cutting", "relationship": "creates", "target": "heterostructures"}, {"source": "Bruel", "relationship": "reviews", "target": "SOI fabrication"}, {"source": "Celler and Cristoloveanu", "relationship": "reviews", "target": "SOI fabrication"}, {"source": "ECS Symposium on SOI", "relationship": "reports", "target": "progress"}, {"source": "ion cutting", "relationship": "requires", "target": "atomically sharp and defect-free interfaces"}, {"source": "donor Si wafer A", "relationship": "receives", "target": "thin thermal oxide"}, {"source": "donor Si wafer A", "relationship": "implants", "target": "dose of H/cm[2]"}]}, {"text_chunk": "as follows: (1) A \u201cdonor\u201d Si wafer \u201cA\u201d is given a thin thermal oxide or else its surface is cleaned and made hydrophilic; (2) wafer A is implanted with a dose of several 10[16] H/cm[2] at a typical energy of tens of keV; (3) a \u201chandle\u201d wafer \u201cB\u201d with a thick, high quality, thermal, CVD or PECVD oxide is bonded hydrophilically to wafer A (this involves a mild anneal to strengthen the bond and improve the interface quality [34]); (4) the bonded pair is annealed up to the blistering temperature; the presence of wafer B on top of wafer A prevents the A surface from deforming and, instead, the gas pres 1 A list of acronyms is given at the beginning of the paper.  2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Therefore, if not specified otherwise, the results presented from hereon pertain to room temperature (RT) implantation of the most standard material, low-doped or undoped Cz-grown Si(001) crystals with resistivity of 1 \u2126 cm or more. Note that amorphous Si does not blister, although both H2 [35, 36] and plateletlike configurations [37] have been detected in a-Si; presumably its structure accommodates isolated H2 or small bubbles or platelets which do not coalesce. 2.1 Dose window giving rise to blistering Blistering is a threshold phenomenon and the minimum ion fluence or H concentration giving rise to blisters would seem to be one of the most fundamental quantities for any microscopic theory.

Nevertheless, the threshold dose has not been the object of much precise and systematic work (presumably because it is tedious work and the prospect of a really accurate theory appears remote). One would also have to define precisely the threshold (scattered blisters or near complete surface coverage?). Most of the literature concerns work done with ion energies in the tens of keV and doses above 4 \u00d7 10[16] H/cm[2], and the threshold is around that value at those energies. Explicit results [3, 38\u201342] are shown in Fig. 2 (lower border of shaded area). Since the fundamental parameter is presumably the H concentration, the ion fluence was converted into the H concentration at its peak, using numerical simulations performed with the code SRIM [43]. It is seen that the threshold is approximately 5 at%. Less well known is the existence of a maximum dose. At low energy (\u226410 keV) there is definitely an upper limit [3], as shown in Fig. 3 for 5 keV: there are no more blisters or craters for 6 \u00d7 10[16] and 1 \u00d7", "relationships": [{"source": "ion fluence", "relationship": "gives rise to", "target": "blisters"}, {"source": "H concentration", "relationship": "gives rise to", "target": "blisters"}, {"source": "threshold dose", "relationship": "is object of", "target": "precise and systematic work"}, {"source": "literature", "relationship": "concerns", "target": "work done with ion energies"}, {"source": "ion energies", "relationship": "are in", "target": "tens of keV"}, {"source": "doses", "relationship": "are above", "target": "4 \u00d7 10[16] H/cm[2]"}, {"source": "threshold", "relationship": "is around", "target": "4 \u00d7 10[16] H/cm[2]"}, {"source": "ion fluence", "relationship": "was converted into", "target": "H concentration"}, {"source": "H concentration", "relationship": "is fundamental parameter", "target": "microscopic theory"}, {"source": "SRIM", "relationship": "performed", "target": "numerical simulations"}, {"source": "threshold", "relationship": "is approximately", "target": "5 at%"}, {"source": "maximum dose", "relationship": "exists", "target": "low energy"}, {"source": "upper limit", "relationship": "is shown in", "target": "Fig. 3"}]}, {"text_chunk": "the threshold is approximately 5 at%.

The width of the blistering window increases with the energy. At a higher energy of 40 keV, Liu et al.

This is consistent with the explanation offered in Ref. [44] for the high dose blister absence: At high dose, the cavity-rich region becomes thick, i.e. not small compared to the ion range, and the stress is rather uniform over this whole thickness. Moreover, the compressive stress generated in its neighbourhood by a gas-filled cavity will tend to close up other nearby cavities: the result is a decrease in the average compressive stress [40].

The absence of dislocations in cross section transmission electron microscopy (XTEM) observations tends to indicate that plastic deformation is not involved [45]. Other simple observations are the following: (i) Although the packing is dense, the blisters do not appear to form a pattern on the surface. This suggests random nucleation of blisters and absence of long-range interactions between them. (ii) The diameter (D) and height (h) distributions are narrow with, e.g., standard deviations of \u223c15% and \u223c30% respectively [46].

These facts suggest again that the blisters are nucleated at randomly located weak spots, from which point they extend in a circle whose radius is determined by the depth at which they are located, and imply a one-toone relationship between depth and radius, in agreement with the mechanics of plate deformation. Perhaps related is the fact that when H is implanted in trenches that are narrower than the normal blister size, the blisters remain circular, though they are quite smaller, instead of conforming to the straight walls of the trenches [2].

There are relatively few quantitative data even for the diameters, or estimates of the gas pressure (P \u223c 1 GPa [4]), contrary to He blisters on metals [14, 15]. Figure 4 shows the available measurements [1, 2, 4, 39, 44, 46] for the average D as a function of the mean H implantation depth R. One must mention that the depth in the data of Huang [39] does not always correspond to the implantation energy: the measurements at the depths of 80 and 300 nm were obtained by implanting at higher energy (19 and 45 keV/atom) through a 150 nm oxide that was removed after implantation; their dose was high (1 \u00d7 10[17] H/cm[2]), corresponding to peak H concentrations in the 15\u201320 at% range.

The trend, as expected, is that the blister diameter increases with the implant depth. One can see that a power law fit (D \u223c R[n]) to the data of Huang gives a rather slow increase, i.e. n \u223c 0.35 (dashed line). It must be said that the diameters are commonly observed to vary with ion dose and anneal temperature (see, e.g. the three points for R = 75 nm). If we use the other data obtained at more typical doses (dot-dash line), we get n \u223c 0.5. Some authors have attempted to use the D vs. R relation to infer blistering mechanisms or material properties. If the blister is viewed as a spherical shell formed by plastic deformation, one can obtain the following equation [47, 48]: D = (16hR\u03c3Y/P)[1/2], (1) where \u03c3Y is the material\u2019s yield stress.

Although this formula was derived in the context of He blistering of metals it is very general. But h and P must be derived from other arguments. If the ratio h/P were constant one would indeed find D \u223c R[1/2]. However, h certainly increases with R, while it is not clear for P, which may result in a higher power n. Referring specifically to H blistering of Si, Huang [39] considered blistering as resulting from cavity enlargement due to crack propagation instead; in this case the relevant material parameters are the surface energy \u03b3, Young\u2019s modulus E and Poisson\u2019s ratio \u03bd; the relation D = 4(\u03b3ER[3]/9\u03b1(1 \u2013 \u03bd[2]) P[2])[1/4] (2) is found, with \u03b1 a geometrical constant of order 1; thus n = 3/4 if P is assumed constant.

This point is important since it implies no loss of H2 by blister rupture at this stage. One should add a caveat: It is known that blisters pop up suddenly (within 2 s [39] and probably less) and at that stage they have a narrow size distribution, but if heating is continued they grow further [e.g. 41]. Since the literature generally does not state precisely at what stage the data were acquired, the published diameters may actually represent overestimates. In addition, at higher doses, not only the yield stress but the ultimate strength of the silicon can be overcome and craters appear (Fig. 1(b), (c)). Since there is no reason to doubt the validity of fracture and deformation mechanics, the real challenge for theory will be to predict the amount of gas that segregates into the cavities and the ensuing pressure.

If the implanted zone is weaker than the wafer-to-wafer bond, then delamination will occur at the implanted depth. From plate mechanics, the separation energy can thus be determined in a situation in which the gas pressure, though probably present, is not the trigger of the delamination. They found the following.

The blister cover thickness (or equivalently the crater depth) is very close to the peak in H concentration or the peak in radiation damage; since these quantities differ by less than 10% [43], only very precise work using ion-beam analysis (IBA) and/or secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and cross section transmission electron microscopy (XTEM) allows a distinction between the two. This point will be discussed in Section 3.7.

Early on, the Grenoble group [31] found that there is no single slope: the data showed a high value of Ea (\u223c2 eV) at temperatures T < 500 \u00b0C, then a break and a low value (\u223c0.5 eV) at high temperature (Fig. 5 [41]). They interpreted this as meaning that the limiting step at lower temperature was the breaking of Si\u2013H bonds to liberate H atoms and form H2 to fill the nascent blisters, whereas, at higher temperature, the diffusion rate of H atoms from the surrounding region into the cavities was the only limitation.

In both models, the orders of magnitude of the bond energies are right. However, these simple pictures became foggy with the finding that the \u201chigh Ea\u201d decreased monotonically with the implanted dose [41, 42]. Figure 6 summarizes the data [4, 41, 42, 50, 51]. In addition, the decrease is confirmed very precisely by the deuterium data of Bedell and Lanford [42] (that could not be shown on the same graph because of an unknown conversion factor). In the framework of the Si\u2013Si bond breaking model, if that energy is identified with the surface energy in Eq. (2), the weakening of Ea could be explained by the increased presence of adsorbed H atoms on the platelet internal surfaces.

Zheng et al. [52] found the same activation energies (high Ea of 1.7 eV and low Ea of 0.7 eV) for all three orientations, but the kinetic prefactor was almost an order of magnitude larger for (001) than for (111), and similarly for (111) compared to (110).

There are admittedly many uncertainties in the interpretation of desorption spectra but it remains true that: (i) desorption peaks coincide in temperature with other events measured by other techniques; and (ii) the blister gas contents appears to be no greater than 1/3 of the implanted dose, i.e. the equivalent of \u22645 \u00d7 10[15] H/cm[2] only at low keV energies or less than 4 monolayers of SiH2 on {100}.

Ion-cutting requires crack propagation over an area (\u223c10[2] cm[2]) approximately 10[10] times larger than blistering (\u223c10[\u20138] cm[2]), it is thus not surprising that it requires longer times than simple blistering [41, 50]. The comparison can hardly be precise since, during isothermal annealing, scattered blisters first appear, followed by blister growth [11], so there is some arbitrariness in defining a \u201cblistering time\u201d. Tong et al. [50] found a typical factor of 10 in splitting times, a small price to pay for a factor of 10[10] in area. This demonstrates that blistering and wafer splitting take place in \u201ccatastrophic\u201d fashion (it generates an audible sound [41]). More importantly, Tong et al. showed that the activation energies for both phenomena are identical (Ea of 1.2 eV for a dose of 1 \u00d7 10[17] cm[\u20132], data included in Fig. 6).

This gives confidence that the physics and chemistry of the two phenomena are the same, except perhaps for the very final purely mechanical step. This has led many to assume that basic studies on blistering of unbonded wafers can be used to quickly explore process improvements or new materials for ion-cutting. This is generally confirmed by comparative studies. At least one counter-example has been found, however. It concerns the maximum blistering dose. Ion-cutting has the same threshold dose of \u223c1.75 \u00d7 10[16] H/cm[2] as blistering at 5 keV, but it has no upper limit [54].

This shows the importance for blistering of the boundary conditions imposed on the stress and strain fields. In this particular case, blistering experiments have led to overly pessimistic prospects on ion-cutting, especially because higher doses give smoother surfaces at those low energies [54]. 3 Mechanistic investigations using microscopic probes 3.1 Transmission electron microscopy of extended defects; platelets It is natural to look for extended structures buried under the surface as the nuclei of blisters.

Actually, the {111} variety had been found earlier in plasma hydrogenated Si [24], and it is the thermodynamically favoured structure [60, 61].

As implied by its notation \u2013 (001), not {100} \u2013 it is located in a plane parallel to the surface. This is of course no coincidence, the compressive stress obviously favours separation of (001) planes and overcomes the normally lower free energy of {111} platelets. In Fig. 8 the flatness and smoothness of the parted planes is to be noted. Similarly, the surrounding lattice is remarkably undisturbed. This is confirmed by the weakness of the strain contrast in TEM [17, 56]. The typical (001) platelet diameters are \u223c10 nm (at RT) and their thickness \u223c1 nm, with a volume of \u223c10[3] \u2126 (atomic volumes).

In addition, some unlikely \u201cvertical\u201d {100} platelets, this time accompanied by strain contrast, have been observed [59]. In Si(111), (111) platelets unsurprisingly dominate [51]. The case of Si(110), which is the least prone to blistering, is interesting: a mixture of {111} and {100} platelets, which cannot be parallel to the surface, is found [51]. These observations all confirm the role of the compressive stress in their nucleation. Moreover, the platelet-forming tendency naturally explains the differences in mechanical strength found for the different orientations (Section 2.2), since platelets obviously weaken the crystal, and also explain the differences in splitting kinetics (Section 2.3.1). Many investigators have noted the close connection between the (001) platelets and hydrogen.

Second, their depth distribution is rather similar to the H distribution and even tends to be narrower [40, 55, 56]. The internal surfaces of the (001) platelet, just like free (001) surfaces, are expected to adsorb H exothermally (\u223c2 eV/atom). Unfortunately, they have not received so far as much theoretical attention as the {111} platelets [60]. 3.1.2 Thermal evolution of platelets Under annealing, platelets grow while their number decreases [41, 55, 56, 62].

Aspar et al. [56] found that the {111} platelets actually do not grow under annealing; only the (001) kind, which are the most numerous and the most centrally located, do so. Figure 9 shows the results of isothermal annealing at 450 \u00b0C on those [62].

(And if there is an H influx, the chemical energy gain is of course much larger than the pressure term.) During growth the platelet depth distribution was also observed to become narrower. If one assumes for simplicity that each platelet internal surface is dihydride-passivated (normal RT configuration since the {100} surface has two dangling bonds), and with a surface density of 6.8 \u00d7 10[14] Si/cm[2], the data of Fig. 9(b) actually correspond to a total of 5 \u00d7 10[15] H/cm[2].

An interesting question is what is the nature of the atoms being exchanged between the platelets during the Ostwald-type phase of the growth (prior to the final crack propagation phase). Of course cavity growth implies exchange of Si atoms or Si vacancies between the platelets. However, the high temperature at which it occurs suggests that its kinetics are limited by another factor, e.g. H atom transport. This is understandable because chemisorbed H is necessary to stabilize the platelets and probably also to weaken Si\u2013Si bonds and lead to platelet enlargement 2,0 1,6 20 18 16 14 12 10 3,0 2,5 2,0 1,5 1,0 0.5 1,2 0,8 0,4 0,0 Density diameter 0 200 400 600 800 0 200 400 600 800 1000 (b) Annealing time (s) (a) Annealing time (s) Fig. 9 Thermal evolution of (001) platelets in H-implanted Si (70 keV, 6 \u00d7 1016 H/cm2) under isothermal annealing at 450 \u00b0C: mean diameter and density (a) and total volume (b) (from Grisolia et al.

In some cases, the microcrack follows an apparently continuous but zigzag path [58, 63]; in one instance, the large (001) platelets were reported to be connected by smaller {111} platelets [4], but this seems surprising in view of the physical separation between the zones occupied by each type. An example of microcracks is shown in Fig. 10 [40]: a typical microcrack diameter is a fraction of a micron, that is an order of magnitude larger than a platelet (Fig. 9) and an order of magnitude smaller than a blister (Fig. 4). It is then natural to consider that microcracking constitutes an intermediate step before blistering.

Such measurements also give the total H contents [4], which can be correlated with the thermal desorption results (Section 2.3.2). A key feature of the H evolution was already observed in 1976 [1], namely a narrowing of the depth distribution under annealing, with the loss occurring mostly on the shallow side.

It may be useful to recall that the enhancement in backscattering yield includes two components.

Second, ions may simply be deflected slightly out of the channel, so that their probability of being backscattered later, deeper inside, becomes that of an ion in a \u201crandom\u201d trajectory; this is called dechannelling and is visible as a deep tail in the backscattering yield. The backscattering yield can be converted into an equivalent \u201cdensity of displaced atoms\u201d. However, that density should not be interpreted too literally as if all due to displaced atoms embedded in an ideal lattice, because the relaxation of the lattice around any kind of defect also gives rise to enhanced scattering [69].

(a) 204, No. 7 (2007) 2143 3.3.1 Dose dependence Both components of backscattering can be seen in the [4]He backscattering spectra of Fig. 12 [40], i.e. displacement damage in the 0.9\u20131.0 MeV energy range, and dechannelling below 0.9 MeV. Several authors [40, 42, 44, 65] have studied the dose dependence of the damage by RBS/C with similar results. The peak value of the yield increases non-linearly with dose: at subthreshold doses (\u22643 \u00d7 10[16] H/cm[2]) the level is very low; around the blistering threshold (\u223c5 \u00d7 10[16] H/cm[2]) it increases super linearly (although it is not blistered at RT); and at the highest doses (\u22657 \u00d7 10[16] H/cm[2]) it saturates.

This indicates that the H atoms and the point defects generated by ion implantation are reacting non linearly to create the complexes that are detected as atomic displacements. It has been known for a long time [18] that H and defects interact synergistically in Si and stabilize defects that would otherwise simply anneal out during RT implantations. (This becomes obvious when H and He implantations are compared: paradoxically, H ions result in much higher damage levels than He [53, 61, 70].) In Fig. 12, the displacement density actually reaches the \u201crandom\u201d level for 1 \u00d7 10[17] H/cm[2], although TEM shows that the crystal is in no way amorphized. This illustrates the fact that na\u00efve interpretation of RBS/C spectra overestimates the real level of disorder [69]. 3.3.2 Dependence on temperature: reverse annealing Pioneering work [1] showed the effect of high temperature annealing after low temperature implantation, i.e. a dramatic increase in both backscattering and dechannelling called reverse annealing.

The 5 keV data set corresponded to a blistering dose, the other two to subthreshold doses. This last fact results in great differences in the absolute levels of displacement damage that are explained by the highly non-linear dependence on dose (Fig. 12). Looking closely at Fig. 13, one notices that the peak shifts in depth at 250 \u00b0C and then back towards the surface at higher temperature; the same two shifts occur, and more markedly, in Ref.

After implantation (bottom curve) a dozen discrete modes show up superimposed on a dominant broadband. The discrete modes are associated with small isolated defect complexes. It can be noticed that interstitial defects are not abundant, only IH2 is seen although interstitials and vacancies are produced in equal numbers by the atomic collisions. This discrepancy has been noted before [21] and is plausibly due to the compressive stress that surrounds an interstitial and repels H atoms. (This argument neglects electrostatic effects, which do not seem to play a large role in blistering). This seems like a nice subject for theory which has treated so far only the energetics of the defects and their vibrational properties [21].

Similar scenarios have been reported by Aspar et al. [41], Moutanabbir and Terreault [81], Weber et al. [64], and D\u00fcngen et al. [84], although minor differences are observed. In Weldon\u2019s data, at 425\u2013550 \u00b0C the intensity around 2100\u20132120 cm[\u20131] and that of V2H6 definitely increase substantially above their RT values, suggesting a transfer of H from multivacancies into these high-k complexes. Only a modest increase is seen in Aspar\u2019s data, and in Moutanabbir\u2019s, Weber\u2019s and D\u00fcngen\u2019s spectra the 2100\u20132120 and V2H6 peaks only seem to emerge from a fading background, accompanied by a narrowing of the lines: it is by no means clear that these modes are fed by the disappearance of other defects.

Moreover, it gives complementary information on basic mechanisms. Personnic et al. [85] measured the IRAS spectrum at several times during isothermal annealing leading to blistering. In the results, shown in Fig. 17(a), the time scale is normalized by the total time (10 min) required for blistering at that temperature (450 \u00b0C). It is seen that a major part of the depletion in Si\u2013H modes takes place during the first 10% of the annealing time; the depletion concerns essentially the multivacancy region. Let us recall that this early time corresponds to the platelet nucleation phase, whereas the long later phase corresponds to Ostwald ripening of the platelets (Section 3.1.2).

Small increases are also observed in the V2H6 and VH4 modes during the first minutes, and in the Si(001):H modes after \u223c30% of the annealing time. These observations indicate that a small fraction of the H atoms liberated by multivacancies is captured by monovacancies, and later by internal surfaces. The conclusion that logically follows from this experiment is that the rate-limiting step in blistering is the Ostwald ripening of the platelets (which is possibly mediated by the transport of hydrogen between the platelets). This type of experiment is promising. First, by performing several IR measurements during the \u201cfirst 10%\u201d, the Si\u2013H dissociation kinetics could be established with precision; and secondly, by studying the platelet growth kinetics during the \u201cremaining 90%\u201d (as in Fig. 9) at several different temperatures, the activation energy for Ostwald ripening could be determined.

The thermal evolution also starts similarly; however, the Si(001):H complexes never really develop, only the V2H6 emerge clearly. These facts of course reinforce the assumption that the Si(001):H associated with the platelets are the essential precursors of the blisters.

(a) 204, No. 7 (2007) 2149 densities generate conditions favourable to internal surface creation. Under annealing these complexes would become less defective and transform into bona fide Si(100):H and V2H6 characterized by sharp lines. Indeed at high temperature the high dose sample evolves rapidly towards the stage depicted in Fig. 16, i.e. a pure dominance of Si(001):H and V2H6. This shows that the H reservoir of the multivacancies is not necessary for blistering and constitutes a waste of hydrogen. 3.4.4 Molecular hydrogen Contrary to IRAS, RSS can detect H2 molecules. Three stretch modes are known, gaseous H2 at 4158 cm[\u20131], H2 in the interstitial Td site at 3601 cm[\u20131] [23, 86] and H2 in multivacancies such as V2, V6 and V10 at 3820 cm[\u20131] [82, 83].

H2(Td) has never been seen in H-implanted Si, only in plasma hydrogenated Si [86], likely because there are stronger traps such as dangling bonds in implanted Si [53]. Both Aspar et al. [11] and D\u00fcngen et al. [84] succeeded in detecting gaseous H2 by focusing their exciting laser microbeam precisely on blisters, see Fig. 20(a). However, they failed to see it in the spaces between blisters or at low or intermediate temperature. It is thus natural to interpret this line as due to gas filling the blister cavities. As for the \u201cVn(3820)\u201d complex, it has been clearly identified at RT by Weber et al. [64], D\u00fcngen et al. [84] and Moutanabbir et al. [71]. Actually, Kilanov et al. [79] have quantified their IRAS data in terms of absolute numbers of H atoms and they claim that the Si\u2013H absorbance accounts for only 60\u201370% of the implant dose, the rest presumably being in the form of H2 in multivacancies.

Both D\u00fcngen and Moutanabbir also studied the thermal behaviour of the Vn(3820) complex, as shown in Fig. 20(b). We see that the H2 in Vn\u2019s disappears above 200 \u00b0C, in agreement with Ref. [83], and consistent with the disappearance of the multivacancy defects in the Si\u2013H Raman modes. Therefore it has nothing to do, at least directly, with the H2 that pressurizes the blisters that show up at quite higher temperature. **300** **oC** **H2(MV)** **200** **oC** **100** **oC** **RT** 3500 3700 3900 4100 4300 4500 a) **-1** **H-H Raman Shift [cm** **]** b) b) **Blister** **4100** **4150** **4200** **4250** **4300** **Wave number (cm-1)** Fig. 20 (online colour at: www.pss-a.com) Raman spectra of H2 stretch modes: (a) the top curve shows the Raman line of gaseous H2 at 4158 cm[\u20131] when the laser microbeam is focused on a blister, while the bottom curve shows no line when the beam is focused elsewhere (from Aspar et al.
