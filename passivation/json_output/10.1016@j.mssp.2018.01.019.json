Interstitial monatomic hydrogen atoms in silicon are known to exist in three charge states: positive (H[+]), neutral (H[0]), and negative (H[-]) [23\u201325]. Depending on the charge states of hydrogen atoms, their diffusivities in the doped silicon are different. Among the three charge states of hydrogen, the diffusivity of H[0] is substantially higher than the other charge states since it is free from the charge effects and electric fields in the silicon [26,27]. Consequently, substantial concentration of the injected hydrogen atoms into silicon can possibly passivate the defects when the hydrogen has a favorable charge state for the specific defects [19]. In the next chapter, the general properties of hydrogen in crystalline silicon, based on the research about charge states of hydrogen, will be summarized.

Lastly, a laser-induced hydrogen passivation technique, which can selectively passivate defective region on the solar cell, will be introduced. Dominated by crystalline silicon solar cells, photovoltaic industries have been developed to compete with other energy sources and renewable energy. For a reduction of solar module price per watt peak, there were many approaches to improve the conversion efficiency of solar cells without substantial cost increase. In order to improve solar cell efficiency, passivation of the silicon surface and bulk is a significant process since the passivation quality decides the minority carrier lifetime. From the integrated circuit fabrication, a hydrogenated amorphous silicon nitride (a-SiNx:H) film, which was deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), was simultaneously applied to solar cells as a passivation layer and an anti-reflection coating (ARC) layer [1,2]. The silicon nitride layer, which is usually processed by reaction of SiH4 and NH3 gas, contains hydrogen atoms that could not free from the silicon substrate during the deposition [3].

Properties of hydrogen in crystalline silicon As mentioned in the introduction, interstitial hydrogen atoms can exist in three charge states depending on the number of electrons they have. Accordingly, each state of hydrogens is favorable to interact with the specific charge state of the defects in the silicon. For example, the negative charge state of hydrogens can neutralize phosphorous dopant atoms or positively-charged transition metal impurities [28\u201330]. Conversely, boron acceptors and negatively-charged transition metal impurities can be neutralized by the positive charge state of hydrogens [31]. Also, the neutralized dopants can be electrically re-activated by the other charge states of hydrogens. Hence, controlling the concentration of specific charge state of hydrogens is important for passivating defects. The relative hydrogen concentration of specific charge state is dominated by the location of Fermi level relative to the donor and acceptor level of hydrogen [32]. Herring et al. reported that the hydrogen donor level is located 0.16 eV under the conduction band and the acceptor level is located about 0.07 eV below the middle of band gap (Fig. 1(a)) [22].

Since the donor level is above the acceptor level, the H[0] is never stable and pairs of them easily transfer an electron from one to the other [33]. As Fig. 1(b) shows, there is a dominant charge state of hydrogen for both n and p type silicon, respectively. Especially, the H[0] is always a minority charge state of hydrogen although it has advantages for efficient defect passivation. The main benefit of the H[0] is that the diffusivity is five orders magnitude higher than the other charge states since it is not influenced by a fixed charge and electric field inside of silicon [23,28,34,35]. Also, it has high reactivity due to a free electron, which can be given to other defects or obtain another electron for bonding. However, the H[0] maintains stability for the order of nanoseconds and then auto-ionizes to the H[+] in the p-type silicon at room temperature [22].

In order to achieve high H[0] concentration, a tempering process can be used since the changed Fermi energy closer to the mid-bandgap can increase the fractional H[0] concentration. Also, an injection of excess carrier from an illumination source can increase the H[0] concentration by converting the Fermi energy into the quasi-Fermi energy. For these reasons, P. Hamer et al. researched the manipulation of minority hydrogen charge states, which was predicted by modeling of the fractional H[0] concentration by combining the temperature conditions and excess carrier densities [33]. The simulated fractional concentration of H[0] showed that there is a maximum point of H[0] concentration at different temperatures depending on each excess carrier density. They compared the simulated data with an effective lifetime data from UMG silicon wafers which were hydrogenated at various annealing temperatures under illumination. Above 550 K of process temperature, the effective lifetime trend",

Advanced hydrogen passivation 3.1. From conventional hydrogen passivation to advanced hydrogen passivation Initially, hydrogen passivation focused on the reduction of surface recombination velocity. Among the successful techniques for using hydrogen, forming gas annealing (FGA) was considered one of the costeffective ways to improve silicon surface quality. FGA is usually conducted at around 400\u2013450 \u00b0C for 5\u201330 min in a furnace. The application of conventional passivation with atomic hydrogen was called the \u2018alneal\u2019 (aluminum anneal) process [36\u201338].

Then the atomic hydrogen diffuses to the Si-SiO2 interface and passivate dangling bond. After the process, the aluminum on the light receiving face side can be removed by phosphoric acid. By applying this technique, J.

Advanced hydrogen passivation for p-type silicon wafers Since the 1970s, minority carrier lifetime of boron doped silicon material which contains high oxygen contents was asymptotically degraded under carrier injection (illumination or bias) due to the adverse influence of B-O related defects [41\u201347]. This CID of solar cells decrease the short-circuit current and the open-circuit voltage [48]. As a result, about 2% of the absolute conversion efficiency can be decreased by the CID in highly boron doped (ND > 10[16] cm[\u2212][3]) oxygen rich silicon under typical working conditions of solar cells [49]. Although the mechanism of CID is still not clear, the current understanding of CID is that the energy from the recombination of the injected minority carrier enhances the",

Although the mechanism of CID is still not clear, the current understanding of CID is that the energy from the recombination of the injected minority carrier enhances the diffusion of the oxygen dimer (O2i) and it binds to the substitutional boron atom (Bs) [50\u201352]. As a result of the recombination enhanced process, the BsO2i complex formation occurs at room temperature with an injected carrier and produces recombination trap sites of minority carriers. The BsO2i can be dissociated by annealing in the dark at temperature above 170 \u00b0C and then, the minority carrier lifetime is recovered [53]. However, the annealed state is not stable since the Bs and O2i are still present in the silicon and can form the B-O complex again under the minority carrier injection [53]. 3.2.1.

Meanwhile, it has been reported that hydrogen in the silicon bulk acts as a significant factor for regeneration of B-O defects. Wilking et al. has shown that a high enough concentration of hydrogen in the silicon bulk is necessary to bring about the regenerate process by applying a cyclic hydrogenation procedure. [57,58]. Each cycle of hydrogenation consists of two steps. First, samples are exposed in a remote hydrogen plasma using microwave-induced remote hydrogen plasma (MIRHP) reactor to passivate boron atoms near the surface with the hydrogen. Second, annealing in nitrogen atmosphere releases hydrogen from the boron atoms.

By using this principle, it was reported that the regeneration rate was increased as the peak firing temperature increased [65]. The Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) measurement revealed that the higher peak temperature of firing transfers more hydrogen from the SiNx:H layers into the silicon. Also, M\u00fcnzer et al. again proved the role of hydrogen by observing that a silicon nitride layer, which was deposited without containing hydrogen by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), showed no improvement of minority carrier lifetime after regeneration [16]. Reversely, hydrogen can be effused from the silicon during the cooling step of firing [7,65\u201369].

In addition, the regeneration rate was influenced by the amount of injected hydrogen when the peak temperature was below 750 \u00b0C. Fig. 3 depicts an example of the samples which were fired at 750 \u00b0C with different belt speed of furnace [65]. Fig. 3(a) is a reference sample which has ten hydrogen atoms in the SiNx:H layer. Fig. 3(b\u2013d) shows the injection of hydrogen at peak temperature of firing, while Fig. 3(e\u2013g) shows the respective effusion of hydrogen during the cooling. Even though the sample in Fig. 3(d), (g) had a lesser amount of hydrogen effusion due to the fast cooling rate, sample in Fig. 3(c), (f) had more amount of hydrogen, since there were more injected hydrogen atoms at peak temperature of firing.

When there is enough hydrogen concentration in the silicon bulk by applying optimized firing process, additional mid-temperature steps are known to influence the following regeneration process [20]. The annealing steps in the mid-temperature range (100 \u2013 400 \u00b0C) for 15 min resulted in the maximum regeneration rate at ~ 230 \u00b0C. Above this temperature, regeneration started to decrease sharply and no regeneration occurred anymore near at 400 \u00b0C. The mechanism of this result, which is suggested by McQuaid et al., is that the thermal energy redistributed the hydrogen to the preferred bound state depending on the temperature. Such hydrogen start to forms boron-hydrogen (B-H) pairs at around 170 \u00b0C. However, at higher temperature above 380 \u00b0C, hydrogen is bound in H2 molecules instead of the B-H pairs. H2 molecules are not easily dissociated under regeneration condition due to their high stability compared to the B-H pairs. For this reason, the B-H pairs can produce more mobile hydrogen atoms in the silicon bulk, which are favorable for the following regeneration process. 3.2.3.

Acceleration of the regeneration rate As Fig. 2 shows, the states of B-O defects are determined by the reaction rate of four transitions (annealing, degradation, regeneration, and destabilization). In order to decrease the duration of hydrogen passivation, the acceleration of the regeneration rate is required. The regeneration reaction can outweigh the other reactions during the process by controlling the intensity of illumination since the other transition reactions are only controlled by temperature. For these reasons, Wilking et al. regenerated samples with 2.7 sun intensity illumination at varied temperatures (120\u2013400 \u00b0C) [20].

They assumed that exposure to the plasma during the deposition could either increase the amount of hydrogen in the dielectric layer or enhance the diffusion of hydrogen into the silicon bulk. Afterwards, the role of exposure to the plasma was studied further to confirm that if the plasma can solely effect on the regeneration process [74]. Samples exposed to the plasma during the silicon nitride PECVD without subsequent firing process did not show stable recovery of bulk lifetime (\u03c4bulk). Also, no recovery was observed when the silicon nitride layer was removed before firing.

Advanced hydrogen passivation for UMG silicon wafers Even though UMG silicon wafers have lower quality compared to the electronic grade silicon wafers, it has been evaluated as a potential low cost material for the solar cell fabrication [86\u201392]. However, the UMG silicon wafers typically contain a relatively high concentration of impurities such as boron, aluminum and phosphorous since the UMG silicon feedstock is purified by a liquid phase purification process [93,94]. For these reasons, passivation of B-O complex in both a n- and a p-type UMG silicon wafer is a significant process if",

The advanced hydrogen passivation was applied on UMG silicon wafers by using a firing belt furnace as a heating source to reach around 620 \u00b0C for 2 s and an illumination source simultaneously. The impact of hydrogen passivation on UMG wafers were greatly dependent on the position of the wafer within the ingot due to the different dopant densities. Wafers from the bottom of the ingot showed significant \u03c4bulk improvement (from 8 \u03bcs to 550 \u03bcs) after hydrogen passivation.

Laser-induced hydrogen passivation Laser technology has been broadly applied in solar cell fabrication such as edge junction isolation, groove formation for buried contacts, selective doping, texturing and ablation of dielectric layers [101\u2013105]. Recently, an application of laser for the hydrogen passivation has been researched since laser has thermal and radiation energy simultaneously. Lasers can contribute to the hydrogen passivation of the local area of cells. Hydrogen passivation using a belt furnace will dehydrogenate some regions on the cells where it had initially high lifetime. However, laser-induced hydrogen passivation is beneficial for recovering only the defective area. This property of laser-induced hydrogenation is significantly valuable since the hydrogenation quality can be degraded again by temperature steps subsequent to hydrogenation [106\u2013108]. Song et al. reported the influence of laser processing parameters on the samples that were passivated by SiNx:H",

In the case of laser power densities, as much as the laser does not break wafers, higher power density improved the \u03c4eff of samples. Also, photoluminescence (PL) image showed that the laser illuminated region was locally passivated. Regarding the scan speed of laser, which were varied from 0.5 to 3.5 mm/s, the hydrogenation effect on the scanned area was increased as the scan speed became slower since the sample had longer time to passivate defects with hydrogen. Substrate temperature conditions, which were controlled by hot plate, also showed differences in hydrogenation amount. At higher temperatures of substrate, lifetime showed more enhancement since hydrogen has much faster diffusivity and is bound with defect rapidly. However, hydrogenation, which was the result of substrate heating, outweighed the laser-induced hydrogenation. As a result, the PL response image revealed that there was no evident brightness improvement in a specific region. As",

As a result, the PL response image revealed that there was no evident brightness improvement in a specific region. As the cooling rate of the firing step needs to be fast to leave more of a hydrogen amount inside of silicon, the cooling rate after the laserinduced hydrogenation should be controlled properly. Samples that were located on the heated hot plate after laser illumination resulted in a poor PL response due to the slower cooling rate compared to the samples that were off the hot plate [110]. For this reason, a high cooling rate is required after laser illumination to prevent subsequent dissociation of hydrogen-defect complexes. In addition, the effects of the laser-induced hydrogenation also can be stronger by a pre-firing step at high temperature since the samples can obtain more hydrogen atoms to be controlled by laser illumination. For effective laser-induced hydrogenation, the decision of the laser wavelength is also one of important parameters.

Samples illuminated with an 808 nm wavelength achieved comparably higher effective lifetime results than samples at 660 nm wavelength. According to their research, there are three major advantages that long wavelength illumination is suitable for the laser-induced hydrogen passivation. First, long wavelength light can generate carriers that are more uniform throughout the bulk. Especially, this property is beneficial to wafers that have non-uniform defect distribution. The second benefit is the reduction of excess energy loss as heat. If the photon generation efficiency is same between different wavelengths of light, the long wavelength light will require less energy process to excite greater carrier concentration. The other benefit comes from reduced irradiation on the wafer due to the long wavelength. The reduced irradiation decreases heat gain which can make the process easy to control the temperature profile.

By using the laser technique, hydrogen passivation was applied on completed cast-monocrystalline silicon solar cells [74,110]. The cell performance was substantially improved after laser-induced hydrogenation. Compared to the reference cell, the hydrogenated cell had 0.61% higher conversion efficiency which was mainly contributed by the 12 mV higher Voc. The enhanced spatial internal quantum efficiency map, which was conducted by a long wave length (981 nm) laser, showed that the Voc gain was mostly obtained by passivation of dislocation clusters in the bulk side. Accordingly, it is obvious that laserinduced hydrogen passivation is a powerful technique for the high efficient solar cell fabrication.

Also, longer wavelength of the laser is easy to control temperature profile. According to the advantages of advanced hydrogen passivation, efficiency and reliability of the various types of solar cells will be substantially improved. In particular, p-type multi-crystalline silicon solar cells, which shares over 60% in the wafer market, have a big possibility to change an overall R&D direction in the PV industries [112]. Also, UMG silicon is given more potential as another low quality silicon substrate when the portion of substrate cost further increases Moreover, advanced hydrogen passivation is suitable for combining with a Ni/Cu-plated contact since an annealing process for the nickel silicide formation can be carried out simultaneously during the hydrogenation process. In case of the laser-induced hydrogen passivation technique, it is valuable for passivating only the defective area on the cells after sorting process of fabrication.
