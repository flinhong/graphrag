[{"text_chunk": "PUBLISHED ONLINE: 29 JUNE 2015 | DOI: 10.1038/NMAT4336 In situ study of the initiation of hydrogen bubbles at the aluminium metal/oxide interface De-Gang Xie[1], Zhang-Jie Wang[1], Jun Sun[1], Ju Li[1,2,3], Evan Ma[1,4]* and Zhi-Wei Shan[1] The presence of excess hydrogen at the interface between a metal substrate and a protective oxide can cause blistering[1\u20133] and spallation of the scale[4\u20138]. However, it remains unclear how nanoscale bubbles manage to reach the critical size in the first place. Here, we perform in situ environmental trans- mission electron microscopy experiments of the aluminium metal/oxide interface under hydrogen exposure. It is found that once the interface is weakened by hydrogen segregation, surface difusion of Al atoms initiates the formation of faceted cavities on the metal side, driven by Wulf reconstruction. The morphology and growth rate of these cavities are highly sensitive to the crystallographic orientation of the aluminium substrate. Once the cavities grow to a critical size, the internal gaspressurecanbecomegreatenoughtoblistertheoxidelayer. Our findings have implications for understanding hydrogen damage of interfaces.

Our findings have implications for understanding hydrogen damage of interfaces. Hydrogen-induced interfacial failure, such as blistering at the metal (M)/oxide (MO) interface and protective scale spallation, is well known to plague native oxides and coatings on metals and alloys. In gas turbines[3,6\u20138], nuclear power plants[9\u201311], humid environments[1,12], or even solar sails[13], such hydrogen-related damage can be severe. It is generally believed that gross interfacial failure begins by the growth of a nanoscale gas bubble[14,15], driven by the internal gas pressure P, that plastically deforms the capping oxide layer to cause a visible outward blister (with radius of curvature, R). Existing models[14,16\u201318] pitch P against the yield strength \u03c3Y, of the MO layer, and its surface energy \u03b3 . One can then derive a critical blister radius RC that depends on P, with the following relationship defining when blistering can occur: P \u2212 [4]3[\u03c3]R[Y][2]C[t][ 2] \u2212 [2]R[\u03b3]C > 0 (1) where t is the MO layer thickness.

For P values of a few hundred megapascals (same order as the bulk yield strength of Al), RC is of the order of tens of nanometres. But if so, how does a \u2018subcritical\u2019 (R < RC) gas bubble grow? Calculations show that the thermal fluctuation energy kBT cannot propel R to RC within the experimental timescale. If one uses an unrealistically high gas pressure P of tens of gigapascals (even higher than the ideal strength of Al), RC can still only be reduced to a few nanometres. In other words, existing theories, although explaining MO blistering at above tens of nanometres, seem to leave a gap below tens of nanometres, where M deformation seems inevitable. This gap in understanding can be filled by recognizing that the metal surface morphology can change in the presence of free surface diffusion, which has been recently shown to be an important deformation mechanism of metals at sub-10-nm scale even at room temperature[19,20].

This speculation is strengthened by the realization that the metal configuration near M/MO is likely to be a metastable, kinetically trapped structure, usually not optimal for M itself in terms of its surface energies. However, if hydrogen atoms segregate to the M/MO interface and sever M\u2013O bonds[21\u201323], the M atoms freed from MO can diffuse more quickly towards the desired shape, dictated by M\u2019s Wulff construction, at least at the nanoscale. This provides an additional thermodynamic driving force unaccounted for in equation (1), which is concerned with only oxide properties, as well as a kinetic pathway to achieve RC because metal surface diffusion is very efficacious at changing morphology at small length scales (rate \u221d r [\u2212][3]; ref. 20).

Once the inwardly growing cavity (Fig. 1b) reaches a critical size, the trapped gas pressure will be sufficient to mechanically push the oxide layer outward. This permits the ensuing oxide blistering (Fig. 1c) that expands outward, causing eventual oxide spallation. To directly observe how the cavity emerges initially underneath the oxide layer, here we have monitored the hydrogenation process of single-crystalline aluminium pillars with a thin layer of native oxide, in a 2 Pa H2 gas environment at room temperature, inside an environmental transmission electron microscope (TEM). Figure 2 shows the bright-field TEM images of a pillar 240 nm in diameter, before and after hydrogen exposure. Two main changes can be clearly observed after exposure to hydrogen: the originally smooth thickness contours and metal/oxide interface have become wavy; blisters form at geometrical edges (red arrows in Fig.", "relationships": [{"source": "interface", "relationship": "weakened by", "target": "hydrogen atoms"}, {"source": "interface-segregating hydrogen atoms", "relationship": "activate", "target": "surface diffusion of metal atoms"}, {"source": "M atoms", "relationship": "diffuse away along", "target": "M/MO interface"}, {"source": "M atoms", "relationship": "evolve towards", "target": "Wulff construction"}, {"source": "inwardly growing cavity", "relationship": "reaches", "target": "critical size"}, {"source": "trapped gas pressure", "relationship": "push", "target": "oxide layer"}, {"source": "oxide blistering", "relationship": "expands", "target": "outward"}, {"source": "oxide blistering", "relationship": "causes", "target": "oxide spallation"}, {"source": "hydrogenation process", "relationship": "monitored", "target": "single-crystalline aluminium pillars"}, {"source": "single-crystalline aluminium pillars", "relationship": "exposed to", "target": "hydrogen"}, {"source": "thickness contours and metal/oxide interface", "relationship": "become", "target": "wavy"}, {"source": "blisters", "relationship": "form at", "target": "geometrical edges"}]}, {"text_chunk": "Figure 2 shows the bright-field TEM images of a pillar 240 nm in diameter, before and after hydrogen exposure.

For comparison, in situ TEM experiments were also conducted in vacuum and with a pure nitrogen gas environment, which showed no such changes in the pillar under similar electron-beam intensity and exposure time, indicating that hydrogen exposure is responsible for the observed blistering and roughening. The main effect of the electron beam in our experiments is to ionize the H2, generating high fugacity to facilitate hydrogen entrance[17]. Figure 3 reveals how the cavities nucleate at the metal/oxide interface. As seen in Fig. 3a, the initial interface is straight and smooth, and so are the thickness contours inside the pillar.

Also, we observed cavity coarsening; that is, big cavities consume the small ones (see Supplementary Fig. 1). This evolution of nanocavities changes the thickness gradient in the near-interface region, giving rise to wavy thickness contours. As dislocation activity is not observed, the formation of the cavity at the oxide/metal interface is made possible by diffusional deformation of the metal surface.

The metal surfaces are then able to locally approach the inclinations dictated by the Wulff construction, due to capillary forces that drive energy minimization. Consequently, {111} facets, which are known to have the lowest surface energy in face-centred cubic metals, are expected to develop. Indeed, as the cavities grow to about w = 20 nm in size (defined by the largest geometric dimension), their profiles show clear straight segments, which result from the projections of {111} facets that comprise the inner cavity surface bordering the Al underneath (Fig. 3c,d).

Obviously, the cavity has to reach a critical size (wc) before the onset of plastic deformation of the oxide layer, because it acts as a pinning constraint on the MO membrane. The initial stage of cavity emergence described above (not due to high internal hydrogen pressure) allows the deformation of the oxide layer to start from a much larger size than those required by traditional pressuredriven models[14,16\u201318]. Therefore, the singularity problem in those nucleation models is resolved. Also, this criterion underscores two directions that may help suppress the unwanted blistering.

The retreating {111} facet at the edge of the pillar also gives us an opportunity to quantitatively estimate the surface diffusivity. By drawing an analogy to the flattening of a wrinkled surface, a quantitative model to estimate the surface diffusivity can be obtained, following the method of refs 24,25. Assuming that the corner is a single-hump wrinkle, we can adopt the final rest position of the {111} facet in Fig. 4d as the reference and measure the height change of the receding facet with time. As plotted in Fig. 4e, the natural logarithm of height is a linear function of time, giving a 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 10 5.0 2.0 1.0 0.5 0.0 \u22120.5 \u22121.0 0 min 25 min Interface at 0 min 0.5 |h \u03bb \u2248 50 nm Slope (S) = \u22123.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 s\u22121|Col2| |---|---| |0 200 400", "relationships": [{"source": "grown cavities", "relationship": "show", "target": "{111} facets"}, {"source": "selected area difraction pattern", "relationship": "has", "target": "beam direction"}, {"source": "beam direction", "relationship": "is along", "target": "[110] zone axis"}, {"source": "pillar", "relationship": "has", "target": "[110] zone axis"}, {"source": "reducing surface roughness", "relationship": "is related to", "target": "engineering the surface orientation"}, {"source": "suppressing surface diffusion", "relationship": "is related to", "target": "adding alloying elements into the base metal"}, {"source": "retreating {111} facet", "relationship": "gives", "target": "opportunity to estimate the surface diffusivity"}, {"source": "quantitative model", "relationship": "can be obtained", "target": "method of refs 24,25"}, {"source": "corner", "relationship": "is", "target": "single-hump wrinkle"}, {"source": "final rest position of the {111} facet", "relationship": "is", "target": "reference"}, {"source": "height change of the receding facet", "relationship": "is measured", "target": "time"}, {"source": "natural logarithm of height", "relationship": "is", "target": "linear function of time"}]}, {"text_chunk": "the natural logarithm of height is a linear function of time, giving a 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 10 5.0 2.0 1.0 0.5 0.0 \u22120.5 \u22121.0 0 min 25 min Interface at 0 min 0.5 |h \u03bb \u2248 50 nm Slope (S) = \u22123.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 s\u22121|Col2| |---|---| |0 200 400 600 800 t (s)|1,0| 37 min (111) 28 min 44 nm Figure 4 | Blister formation accompanying the receding faceted surface. a, The initial metal/oxide interface near an edge of the pillar; this reference profile of the interface is superimposed in b\u2013d using a white dotted line. b, Cavity nucleation at the edge, with the metal surface retracted.

As already shown in Fig. 4, the cavity on {111} has the fastest growth rate and reaches wc the earliest. Figure 5 thus suggests that to delay blistering in the surface oxide, the metal should avoid low-energy planes parallel to its surfaces. We have discovered that long before visible blisters are created, cavities form beneath the oxide film on hydrogen exposure, driven by Wulff reconstruction and freed-metal surface diffusion. We name this phenomenon \u2018pre-blister cavitation\u2019, which occurs on the metal side. Our findings suggest that it takes much less hydrogen to weaken the interface to allow Wulff reconstruction than to blister the oxide layer. This has implications for understanding the integrity/damage of coatings and passivation films on metals, where hydrogen-induced interfacial failure is a major threat. In particular, even when the blisters stay subcritical (Fig. 1b) owing to very small Wulff cavities (say \u223c5 nm), these very small Wulff cavities are still hidden damage that greatly reduces the interfacial delamination strength, by providing potential nucleation and coalescence sites for interfacial fracture under external stress.

Therefore, blistering is a final-stage visible symptom of hydrogen damage of the interface, but not a necessary condition for markedly easier scale spallation from the substrate[6,29].
