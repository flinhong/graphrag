These high efficiency cell architectures typically require high quality crystalline silicon wafers to obtain a high bulk lifetime. However, high quality silicon wafers are very expensive and hence are typically not adopted by photovoltaic industry from the viewpoint of cost. Therefore, a good passivation of low cost silicon wafers becomes of great importance to the photovoltaic industry. Nevertheless, low cost silicon wafers suffer from various kinds of defects, like grain boundary (GB), dislocation, metallic impurities, boron\u2013oxygen (B\u2013O) related defects, light and elevated temperature induced degradation (LeTID) defect and etc. Hydrogenation is an effective method to passivate most of defects in crystalline silicon, and thus becomes an important technique to improve cell efficiency in photovoltaic industry [5, 6].

Nevertheless, hydrogenation technique is a complex research, its mechanisms and effectiveness depends on many factors such as the defect type, excess carrier concentration and etc, and therefore it is crucial to introduce hydrogenation study via differentiating the different categories of the defect types. Moreover, recent research on hydrogenation carefully studies the manipulation of charge states of hydrogen on passivating various kinds of defects, and many interesting results emerged associated with the better cell performance. To give an overview on hydrogenation research, we will first introduce the fundamental properties of hydrogen in crystalline silicon, and then the applications of hydrogenation on deactivating/inducing various kinds of defects, and finally the benefits of hydrogenation on next-generation crystalline silicon solar cells. To understand hydrogenation, it is essential to introduce the fundamental properties of hydrogen in crystalline silicon, which includes the introduction of hydrogen solubility, diffusivity, charge states, energy levels in bandgap and the hydrogen source.

Here a brief outlook of the fundamental properties of hydrogen in crystalline silicon is summarized. To begin with, the solubility of hydrogen in crystalline silicon heavily depends on temperature. For instance, Binns et al [7] claimed an expression for hydrogen solubility in crystalline silicon for the temperature ranging from 900 _[\u25e6]C to 1300_ _[\u25e6]C, finding that_ the solubility of hydrogen increases exponentially with the temperature in the given temperature range. For the general concern, the solubility of hydrogen in crystalline silicon at room temperature is found to be around 10[16] atoms cm[\u2212][3] as reported in [8]. In addition, the solubility of hydrogen is found to increase with the concentration of crystallographic defects in crystalline silicon [9], and therefore multi-crystalline silicon typically can incorporate more interstitial hydrogen in silicon bulk. For hydrogen diffusivity, the diffusivity of hydrogen depends on many factors like temperature, dopant type and concentration, internal/external electric field and etc. When temperature is above 700 _[\u25e6]C, hydrogen diffuses very fast and_ dominantly in the form of interstitial hydrogen [10, 11].

When temperature is modest (e.g. between 200 _[\u25e6]C and 700_ _[\u25e6]C),_ the hydrogen diffusivity is dramatically reduced due to its interactions with dopants and impurities [12, 13], however, in this case hydrogen still diffuses dominantly in the form of interstitial hydrogen. Nevertheless, when temperature is below 200 _[\u25e6]C, hydrogen mainly diffuses in the form of hydro-_ gen dimers and its diffusivity is determined by the diffusivity of hydrogen dimers in crystalline silicon, which is typically very slow. For hydrogen charge state, it is another important property of atomic hydrogen, as it can significantly influence the interstitial hydrogen\u2019s diffusivity and reactivity. In detail, Johnson et al [14] first reported that interstitial hydrogen occupies three charge states in crystalline silicon, namely H[+] (positively charged), H[\u2212] (negatively charged) and H[0] (neutral). Besides, the fractional concentrations of H[+], H[\u2212] and H[0] vary with the position of Fermi level in silicon bandgap [15].

For instance, the majority of interstitial hydrogen is H[+] in p-type silicon due to the abundant of holes, whereas the majority of interstitial hydrogen is H[\u2212] in n-type silicon. Manipulation of hydrogen charge states can have significant impacts on their diffusivity and electronic properties. For example, Kamiura _et al [16] reported an enhanced diffusivity of H[0]_ over H[+] and H[\u2212] about five orders of magnitude at 423 K. In terms of the reactivity, Liu et al [17] reported an enhanced passivation of interstitial iron in silicon by taking advantage of H[0] or H[\u2212]. Moreover, Hallam et al [18] reported the accelerated passivation of B\u2013O related defects via laser changing the hydrogen charge state to H[0] or H[\u2212].

These two energy levels indicate that interstitial hydrogen processes a negative U property in concentration [19], which suggests that H[0] can never be a dominant hydrogen species. For the hydrogen source in crystalline silicon, it can typically be the hydrogenated silicon nitride, hydrogen plasma, hydrogen forming gas and etc. Nevertheless, for the commercial applications, the hydrogenated silicon nitride is widely adopted as the hydrogen source. Generally, the hydrogen content in the hydrogenated silicon nitride is modulated by varying the refractive index of the film, which changes the concentrations of Si\u2013H and N\u2013H bonds in the film. In summary, understanding the fundamental properties of hydrogen in crystalline silicon is crucial and more details are provided in section 2.

Crystallographic defects are another type of defects that can be deactivated by hydrogen. Hydrogenation of dislocation is widely reported and its effectiveness depends on the dislocation type, the contamination level and the processing conditions.

Moreover, Ciesla et al [22] reported that hydrogen charge state manipulation can enhance the passivation effectiveness of dislocation by interstitial hydrogen. In detail, they compared the impact of illuminated annealing and dark annealing on dislocation passivation, and found that illuminated annealing can increase the passivation extent of dislocation in cast mono-like silicon, which is due to that illuminated annealing changes the charge state of interstitial hydrogen into H[0] and H[\u2212]. GB is another typical type of crystallographic defects that can be passivated by hydrogen. It is found that the passivation effectiveness of GB by hydrogen strongly depends on the GB character and the contamination level. For instance, Bardhadi et al [23] reported that hydrogen is more effective for the passivation of small angle GB as compared to large angle GB, as large angle GB typically has a strong ability to getter impurities into it.

It was demonstrated by Park et al [24] that hydrogenation can decrease the density of dangling bonds in clean GB by a factor of between three and an order of magnitude. In contrast, hydrogenation on GB decorated with metallic impurity was much weaker as reported by Jiang et al [25]. It was found that the density of the contaminated GB states varied only slightly after hydrogenation. Hydrogenation is also able to passivate various kinds of metal impurities in crystalline silicon. For instance, Jones et al [26] reported hydrogenation of nickel impurity in crystalline silicon. Moreover, Cu, Ag, Au and Pt are reported to be effectively passivated by interstitial hydrogen [27].

Hydrogen can not only passivate defects, but also can induce defects in crystalline silicon. Recently, it was widely reported that hydrogen is responsible for the formation and activation of LeTID defect in crystalline silicon [30].

Hydrogenation is vital not only due to the ability of hydrogen to passivate almost all of typical defects in crystalline silicon, but also due to the ability of hydrogenation to significantly improve the efficiency and the open circuit voltage of the commercial solar cells (e.g. PERC) and the next-generation solar cells (e.g. TOPCon and SHJ). It was demonstrated by Ciesla et al [32] that a hydrogenation process applied at the step of metal sintering was able to enhance the efficiency of PERC solar cells by more than 0.2% absolute. Furthermore, Liu et al [33] modified the refractive index of hydrogen containing films to enhance the hydrogen in-diffusion to the silicon bulk, which enables a high efficiency of 23.22% achieved on n-type cast-mono silicon PERC solar cells.

Diverse forms of hydrogen_ After the introduction of hydrogen into the crystalline silicon, hydrogen can exist in several forms, including hydrogen platelet, hydrogen dimer, interstitial hydrogen and hydrogen bound state. First of all, interstitial hydrogen is an important form of hydrogen in crystalline silicon, as it is chemically active to passivate various kinds of defects. At high temperatures above 900 _[\u25e6]C, almost all the hydrogen is in the form of intersti-_ tial hydrogen. Nevertheless, the fraction of interstitial hydrogen decreases rapidly with the decreased temperature. When the temperature is below 100 _[\u25e6]C, interstitial hydrogen only_ accounts for a small fraction of total hydrogen concentration, as most of interstitial hydrogen will bond to dopants/defects or form dimers.

Second, hydrogen can be in a bound state, for instance bound to dopants, or metallic impurities, or silicon dangling bonds. Hydrogen-dopant complex is widely reported and studied, which are typically H\u2013B and H\u2013P complexes in conventional silicon solar cells. Recent study [37] suggested that H\u2013Ga complex also existed in gallium doped crystalline silicon and had a higher formation energy as compared to H\u2013B complex.

H-dangling bond complex is very common in crystalline silicon, it exists in the hydrogen passivated silicon surface, dislocation and GB [38]. H-dangling bond complex is typically very stable against the illumination and the modest temperature, but carrier injection is able to lower its binding energy. More details on H-dangling bond complex can be found in sections 3.3\u20133.5. Third, hydrogen is able to form dimers in crystalline sil icon. In a recent paper, Voronkov et al [39] found that there exists three kinds of hydrogen dimers in crystalline silicon after the co-firing process, which is named as H2A (one metastable hydrogen dimer structure), H2B (one stable hydrogen dimer structure) and H2C (another metastable hydrogen dimer structure) [15], respectively.

Up to date, the pairing reaction of H2B cannot be specified yet, but most likely it involves a reaction of atomic hydrogen with H\u2013B complex. H2C is a stable dimer with a low diffusivity that is created during the exposure to a plasma, then in-diffuses from the surface, and also can be generated in the sample bulk. Furthermore, H2C can be produced by annealing samples quenched from high T. The pairing reaction to create H2C is most likely H[+]+ HB \u2192 H2C + B[\u2212] + 2 h[+]. The conversion of H\u2013B complex to H2A and H2C dimers by annealing can somewhat be seen via figure 1.

Fourth, hydrogen is able to form platelets at the silicon sur face when silicon sample is processed with hydrogen plasma treatment. In the literature, Nickel et al [40] found that hydrogen induced platelets can only form for the Fermi-level positions of EC\u2212EF < 0.3 eV and confirmed that the formation of hydrogen-induced platelets is solely controlled by the Fermi energy, as shown in figure 2.

Nevertheless, carrier injection is able to enhance the fractional concentration of the minority hydrogen charge state significantly, and hence improve the effectiveness of hydrogenation. For example, Sun et al [42] studied the impacts of carrier injection on the concentration of H[0] via using the model of Sah-Shockley statistics, which can be well revealed by figure 4. In their paper, the concentration of H[0] is positively correlated with the performance of hydrogenation. More details on hydrogen charge state modulation can be found in the review paper by Hallam et al [43]. It is worth noting that manipulation of hydrogen charge state plays a significant role on enhancing the effectiveness of defect passivation.

In summary, hydrogen has three charge states in crystalline silicon, namely H[+], H[\u2212] and H[0]. The fractional concentration of these three charge states depends on the position of Fermi level in silicon bandgap. As the Fermi level approaches to the conduction band, the H[\u2212] dominates over all the interstitial hydrogen. Whereas the Fermi level approaches to the valence band, the H[+] dominates. Hydrogen can introduce two energy levels in silicon bandgap at Ec \u2212 0.16 eV (donor level) and _Ev + 0.48 eV (acceptor level). As the donor level of hydrogen_ is above the acceptor level, hydrogen is a negative-U impurity, which means that H[0] can never be a dominant hydrogen specie. In addition, hydrogen charge states play an important role on hydrogen electrical properties. Recent works demonstrated that manipulation of hydrogen charge states can significantly improve the hydrogenation performance. _2.3.

However, at low temperatures below 900 _[\u25e6]C, the solubility of hydrogen should_ be below the above trend due to the interaction with dopants. _2.4. Diffusivity of hydrogen_ The diffusivity of hydrogen in crystalline silicon was extensively studied by researchers. Wieringen et al [8] first derived the hydrogen diffusivity at high temperatures ranging from 1243 to 1473 K, as expressed in equation (4). At such high temperatures, hydrogen dominantly exist in the form of interstitial hydrogen, and hence this extracted diffusivity data is typically considered as the upper limit for hydrogen diffusivity: **_DH = 9.4 \u00d7 10[\u2212][3]_** **exp** _\u22120.48 eV kT[\u2212][1][)]_ **cm[2]** **s[\u2212][1].** (4) ( At intermediate temperatures ranging from 702 to 1073 K, many controversial results on hydrogen diffusivity were reported with the maximum difference about five orders of magnitude at a fixed temperature.

A comprehensive discussion of discrepancies on hydrogen diffusivity data in this temperature range is given in the [43]. Furthermore, Hallam et al [43] also summarized the hydrogen diffusivity data from the literature, which is shown in figure 5. It is worth noting that at this temperature range, the hydrogen diffusivity is dominated by the diffusivity of interstitial hydrogen, as other forms of hydrogen diffuse very slowly as compared to the interstitial hydrogen. At low temperatures ranging from 300 to 473 K, hydrogen transport in silicon is not dominated by atomic hydrogen, but by a mix of the diffusion of hydrogen dimers and the diffusion of excess hydrogen atoms, as reported by Saad et al [47].

Interestingly, Kamiura et al [48] even reported hydro gen diffusivity at the temperatures below room temperature between 220 and 270 K, as expressed in equation (5). The authors attributed this diffusivity to the diffusivity of H[+] or H[0] and believed that H[0] has an activation energy of \u223c0.5 eV over a wide range of temperatures from 220 to 1473 K: **Figure 4.

Nevertheless, as far as the authors know, no hydrogen solubility data at low temperature is reported in the literature, possibly due to the detection limit of the characterization tools.

For example, hydrogen plasma and hydrogen ion implantation can introduce hydrogen atoms into crystalline silicon at a relative low temperature, but they can cause crystalline damage due to the high energy of the bombardment of hydrogen atoms from the equipment [55, 56]. Forming gas annealing will not cause crystalline damages, but it must be conducted at a relative high temperature exceeding 900 _[\u25e6]C [57]. Chemical cleaning/etching is conducted at a_ low temperature below 100 _[\u25e6]C and will not cause crystalline_ damage, but it can only introduce hydrogen into the surface of crystalline silicon roughly within 3 \u00b5m of silicon surface [58]. In this paper, we mainly introduce the SiNx:H film as the hydrogen source due to its wide applications in industry. The hydrogen within the SiNx:H film is dominantly bonded to the silicon atom or the nitride atom via the Si\u2013H bond or the N\u2013H bond.

It is important to distinguish the silicon rich SiNx:H film and the nitride rich SiNx:H film, as they have distinct properties regarding to hydrogen. It was found that the silicon rich SiNx:H film contains more hydrogen in the as-deposited condition, however, after firing most of hydrogen escapes out of the SiNx:H film as hydrogen molecules due to the less dense film [61]. The nitride rich SiNx:H film contains less hydrogen, but most of hydrogen can diffuse into crystalline silicon in its atomic form due to the denser film [61]. Typically as reported in the literature [62, 63], the silicon sample coated with the silicon rich SiNx:H film has a better minority carrier lifetime in the as-deposited condition, whereas Si/N equal SiNx:H film can achieve the highest lifetime enhancement after firing.
