These high efficiency cell architectures typically require high quality crystalline silicon wafers to obtain a high bulk lifetime. However, high quality silicon wafers are very expensive and hence are typically not adopted by photovoltaic industry from the viewpoint of cost. Therefore, a good passivation of low cost silicon wafers becomes of great importance to the photovoltaic industry. Nevertheless, low cost silicon wafers suffer from various kinds of defects, like grain boundary (GB), dislocation, metallic impurities, boron\u2013oxygen (B\u2013O) related defects, light and elevated temperature induced degradation (LeTID) defect and etc. Hydrogenation is an effective method to passivate most of defects in crystalline silicon, and thus becomes an important technique to improve cell efficiency in photovoltaic industry [5, 6].

Nevertheless, hydrogenation technique is a complex research, its mechanisms and effectiveness depends on many factors such as the defect type, excess carrier concentration and etc, and therefore it is crucial to introduce hydrogenation study via differentiating the different categories of the defect types. Moreover, recent research on hydrogenation carefully studies the manipulation of charge states of hydrogen on passivating various kinds of defects, and many interesting results emerged associated with the better cell performance. To give an overview on hydrogenation research, we will first introduce the fundamental properties of hydrogen in crystalline silicon, and then the applications of hydrogenation on deactivating/inducing various kinds of defects, and finally the benefits of hydrogenation on next-generation crystalline silicon solar cells. To understand hydrogenation, it is essential to introduce the fundamental properties of hydrogen in crystalline silicon, which includes the introduction of hydrogen solubility, diffusivity, charge states, energy levels in bandgap and the hydrogen source. Here a brief outlook of the fundamental properties of hydrogen in crystalline silicon is summarized. To begin with, the solubility of hydrogen in crystalline silicon heavily depends on temperature.

Here a brief outlook of the fundamental properties of hydrogen in crystalline silicon is summarized. To begin with, the solubility of hydrogen in crystalline silicon heavily depends on temperature. For instance, Binns et al [7] claimed an expression for hydrogen solubility in crystalline silicon for the temperature ranging from 900 _[\u25e6]C to 1300_ _[\u25e6]C, finding that_ the solubility of hydrogen increases exponentially with the temperature in the given temperature range. For the general concern, the solubility of hydrogen in crystalline silicon at room temperature is found to be around 10[16] atoms cm[\u2212][3] as reported in [8]. In addition, the solubility of hydrogen is found to increase with the concentration of crystallographic defects in crystalline silicon [9], and therefore multi-crystalline silicon typically can incorporate more interstitial hydrogen in silicon bulk. For hydrogen diffusivity, the diffusivity of hydrogen depends on many factors like temperature, dopant type and concentration, internal/external electric field and etc. When temperature is above 700 _[\u25e6]C, hydrogen diffuses very fast and_ dominantly in the form of interstitial hydrogen [10, 11].

When temperature is modest (e.g. between 200 _[\u25e6]C and 700_ _[\u25e6]C),_ the hydrogen diffusivity is dramatically reduced due to its interactions with dopants and impurities [12, 13], however, in this case hydrogen still diffuses dominantly in the form of interstitial hydrogen. Nevertheless, when temperature is below 200 _[\u25e6]C, hydrogen mainly diffuses in the form of hydro-_ gen dimers and its diffusivity is determined by the diffusivity of hydrogen dimers in crystalline silicon, which is typically very slow. For hydrogen charge state, it is another important property of atomic hydrogen, as it can significantly influence the interstitial hydrogen\u2019s diffusivity and reactivity. In detail, Johnson et al [14] first reported that interstitial hydrogen occupies three charge states in crystalline silicon, namely H[+] (positively charged), H[\u2212] (negatively charged) and H[0] (neutral). Besides, the fractional concentrations of H[+], H[\u2212] and H[0] vary with the position of Fermi level in silicon bandgap [15].

Besides, the fractional concentrations of H[+], H[\u2212] and H[0] vary with the position of Fermi level in silicon bandgap [15]. For instance, the majority of interstitial hydrogen is H[+] in p-type silicon due to the abundant of holes, whereas the majority of interstitial hydrogen is H[\u2212] in n-type silicon. Manipulation of hydrogen charge states can have significant impacts on their diffusivity and electronic properties. For example, Kamiura _et al [16] reported an enhanced diffusivity of H[0]_ over H[+] and H[\u2212] about five orders of magnitude at 423 K. In terms of the reactivity, Liu et al [17] reported an enhanced passivation of interstitial iron in silicon by taking advantage of H[0] or H[\u2212]. Moreover, Hallam et al [18] reported the accelerated passivation of B\u2013O related defects via laser changing the hydrogen charge state to H[0] or H[\u2212].

These two energy levels indicate that interstitial hydrogen processes a negative U property in concentration [19], which suggests that H[0] can never be a dominant hydrogen species. For the hydrogen source in crystalline silicon, it can typically be the hydrogenated silicon nitride, hydrogen plasma, hydrogen forming gas and etc. Nevertheless, for the commercial applications, the hydrogenated silicon nitride is widely adopted as the hydrogen source. Generally, the hydrogen content in the hydrogenated silicon nitride is modulated by varying the refractive index of the film, which changes the concentrations of Si\u2013H and N\u2013H bonds in the film. In summary, understanding the fundamental properties of hydrogen in crystalline silicon is crucial and more details are provided in section 2.

Crystallographic defects are another type of defects that can be deactivated by hydrogen. Hydrogenation of dislocation is widely reported and its effectiveness depends on the dislocation type, the contamination level and the processing conditions. For instance, Martinuzzi et al [21] found that the dislocation in crystalline silicon exhibits two kinds of defect energy levels, namely deep defect energy level and shallow defect energy ----- J.

Moreover, Ciesla et al [22] reported that hydrogen charge state manipulation can enhance the passivation effectiveness of dislocation by interstitial hydrogen. In detail, they compared the impact of illuminated annealing and dark annealing on dislocation passivation, and found that illuminated annealing can increase the passivation extent of dislocation in cast mono-like silicon, which is due to that illuminated annealing changes the charge state of interstitial hydrogen into H[0] and H[\u2212]. GB is another typical type of crystallographic defects that can be passivated by hydrogen. It is found that the passivation effectiveness of GB by hydrogen strongly depends on the GB character and the contamination level. For instance, Bardhadi et al [23] reported that hydrogen is more effective for the passivation of small angle GB as compared to large angle GB, as large angle GB typically has a strong ability to getter impurities into it.

In terms of contamination level, GB passivation by hydrogen is normally more effective for clean GB as compared to the contaminated counterpart. It was demonstrated by Park et al [24] that hydrogenation can decrease the density of dangling bonds in clean GB by a factor of between three and an order of magnitude. In contrast, hydrogenation on GB decorated with metallic impurity was much weaker as reported by Jiang et al [25]. It was found that the density of the contaminated GB states varied only slightly after hydrogenation. Hydrogenation is also able to passivate various kinds of metal impurities in crystalline silicon. For instance, Jones et al [26] reported hydrogenation of nickel impurity in crystalline silicon. Moreover, Cu, Ag, Au and Pt are reported to be effectively passivated by interstitial hydrogen [27]. Recently, it was found that hydrogen plays an important role on the permanent deactivation of B\u2013O related defects.
