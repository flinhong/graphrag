**Abstract**
Crystalline silicon solar cells are always moving towards ‘high efficiency and low cost’, which
requires continuously improving the quality of crystalline silicon materials. Nevertheless,
crystalline silicon materials typically contain various kinds of impurities and defects, which act
as carrier recombination centers. Therefore these impurities and defects must be well controlled
during the solar cell fabrication processes to improve the cell efficiency. Hydrogenation of
crystalline silicon is one important method to deactivate these impurities and defects, which is
so-called ‘hydrogenation engineering’ in this paper. Hydrogen is widely reported to be able to
passivate diverse defects like crystallographic defects, metallic impurities, boron-oxygen related
defects and etc, but the effectiveness of hydrogen passivation depends strongly on the
processing conditions. Moreover, in this decade, advanced hydrogenation technique has been
developed and widely applied in the photovoltaic industry to significantly improve the
performance of silicon solar cells. As the research on hydrogenation study has made a
significant progress, it is the right time to write a review paper on introducing the state-of-the-art
hydrogenation study and its applications in photovoltaic industry. The paper first introduces the
fundamental properties of hydrogen in crystalline silicon and then discusses the applications of
hydrogen on deactivating/inducing typical defects (e.g. dislocations, grain boundaries, various
metallic impurities, boron–oxygen related defects and light and elevated temperature induced
degradation defect) in p- and n-type crystalline silicon, respectively. At last, the benefits of
hydrogenation engineering on the next-generation silicon solar cells (e.g. tunnel oxide
passivated contact (TOPCon) and silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells) are discussed.
Overall, it was found that hydrogen can deactivate most of typical defects (sometimes induce
defect) in n- and p-type crystalline silicon, leading to a significant efficiency enhancement in
passivated emitter rear contact, TOPCon and SHJ solar cells. In conclusion, the paper aims to
assist young researchers to better understand hydrogenation research.

**1. Introduction**

Crystalline silicon solar cells always move towards ‘high efficiency and low cost’. To achieve this goal, some new device
architectures of silicon solar cells were invented to pursue high
efficiency, including passivated emitter rear contact (PERC),
tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon), silicon heterojunction (SHJ), interdigitated back contact solar cells [1–4]. These
high efficiency cell architectures typically require high quality
crystalline silicon wafers to obtain a high bulk lifetime. However, high quality silicon wafers are very expensive and hence
are typically not adopted by photovoltaic industry from the
viewpoint of cost. Therefore, a good passivation of low cost
silicon wafers becomes of great importance to the photovoltaic industry. Nevertheless, low cost silicon wafers suffer from
various kinds of defects, like grain boundary (GB), dislocation, metallic impurities, boron–oxygen (B–O) related defects,
light and elevated temperature induced degradation (LeTID)
defect and etc. Hydrogenation is an effective method to passivate most of defects in crystalline silicon, and thus becomes
an important technique to improve cell efficiency in photovoltaic industry [5, 6]. Nevertheless, hydrogenation technique is
a complex research, its mechanisms and effectiveness depends
on many factors such as the defect type, excess carrier concentration and etc, and therefore it is crucial to introduce hydrogenation study via differentiating the different categories of
the defect types. Moreover, recent research on hydrogenation
carefully studies the manipulation of charge states of hydrogen on passivating various kinds of defects, and many interesting results emerged associated with the better cell performance. To give an overview on hydrogenation research, we will
first introduce the fundamental properties of hydrogen in crystalline silicon, and then the applications of hydrogenation on
deactivating/inducing various kinds of defects, and finally the
benefits of hydrogenation on next-generation crystalline silicon solar cells.
To understand hydrogenation, it is essential to introduce
the fundamental properties of hydrogen in crystalline silicon,
which includes the introduction of hydrogen solubility, diffusivity, charge states, energy levels in bandgap and the hydrogen source. Here a brief outlook of the fundamental properties of hydrogen in crystalline silicon is summarized. To begin
with, the solubility of hydrogen in crystalline silicon heavily
depends on temperature. For instance, Binns et al [7] claimed
an expression for hydrogen solubility in crystalline silicon for
the temperature ranging from 900 _[◦]C to 1300_ _[◦]C, finding that_
the solubility of hydrogen increases exponentially with the
temperature in the given temperature range. For the general
concern, the solubility of hydrogen in crystalline silicon at
room temperature is found to be around 10[16] atoms cm[−][3] as
reported in [8]. In addition, the solubility of hydrogen is found
to increase with the concentration of crystallographic defects
in crystalline silicon [9], and therefore multi-crystalline silicon typically can incorporate more interstitial hydrogen in silicon bulk. For hydrogen diffusivity, the diffusivity of hydrogen
depends on many factors like temperature, dopant type and
concentration, internal/external electric field and etc. When
temperature is above 700 _[◦]C, hydrogen diffuses very fast and_


dominantly in the form of interstitial hydrogen [10, 11]. When
temperature is modest (e.g. between 200 _[◦]C and 700_ _[◦]C),_
the hydrogen diffusivity is dramatically reduced due to its
interactions with dopants and impurities [12, 13], however,
in this case hydrogen still diffuses dominantly in the form
of interstitial hydrogen. Nevertheless, when temperature is
below 200 _[◦]C, hydrogen mainly diffuses in the form of hydro-_
gen dimers and its diffusivity is determined by the diffusivity
of hydrogen dimers in crystalline silicon, which is typically
very slow. For hydrogen charge state, it is another important
property of atomic hydrogen, as it can significantly influence
the interstitial hydrogen’s diffusivity and reactivity. In detail,
Johnson et al [14] first reported that interstitial hydrogen occupies three charge states in crystalline silicon, namely H[+] (positively charged), H[−] (negatively charged) and H[0] (neutral).
Besides, the fractional concentrations of H[+], H[−] and H[0] vary
with the position of Fermi level in silicon bandgap [15]. For
instance, the majority of interstitial hydrogen is H[+] in p-type
silicon due to the abundant of holes, whereas the majority of
interstitial hydrogen is H[−] in n-type silicon. Manipulation of
hydrogen charge states can have significant impacts on their
diffusivity and electronic properties. For example, Kamiura
_et al [16] reported an enhanced diffusivity of H[0]_ over H[+] and
H[−] about five orders of magnitude at 423 K. In terms of the
reactivity, Liu et al [17] reported an enhanced passivation of
interstitial iron in silicon by taking advantage of H[0] or H[−].
Moreover, Hallam et al [18] reported the accelerated passivation of B–O related defects via laser changing the hydrogen charge state to H[0] or H[−]. The energy levels of interstitial
hydrogen in crystalline silicon are reported by Herring et al

[15], which lie at Ec (conduction band)—0.16 eV for donor
level and Ei (middle bandgap)—0.07 eV for acceptor level.
These two energy levels indicate that interstitial hydrogen processes a negative U property in concentration [19], which
suggests that H[0] can never be a dominant hydrogen species.
For the hydrogen source in crystalline silicon, it can typically
be the hydrogenated silicon nitride, hydrogen plasma, hydrogen forming gas and etc. Nevertheless, for the commercial
applications, the hydrogenated silicon nitride is widely adopted as the hydrogen source. Generally, the hydrogen content
in the hydrogenated silicon nitride is modulated by varying
the refractive index of the film, which changes the concentrations of Si–H and N–H bonds in the film. In summary, understanding the fundamental properties of hydrogen in crystalline
silicon is crucial and more details are provided in section 2.
Hydrogenation has wide applications in deactivating/passivating various kinds of defects in crystalline silicon. One
of these applications is the hydrogen deactivation of dopants
in crystalline silicon. So far, hydrogen was reported to be
able to deactivate boron and phosphorus [20], leading to
the reduced effective doping of crystalline silicon. Crystallographic defects are another type of defects that can be deactivated by hydrogen. Hydrogenation of dislocation is widely
reported and its effectiveness depends on the dislocation type,
the contamination level and the processing conditions. For
instance, Martinuzzi et al [21] found that the dislocation in
crystalline silicon exhibits two kinds of defect energy levels,
namely deep defect energy level and shallow defect energy

level. The deep defect energy level is associated with the dislocation part decorated with metallic impurity and the shallow defect energy level is associated with the dislocation
part with little impurity contamination. It is found that the
shallow defect energy level can be completely passivated by
hydrogen, whereas the deep defect energy level is transformed
into the shallow energy level by hydrogenation. Moreover,
Ciesla et al [22] reported that hydrogen charge state manipulation can enhance the passivation effectiveness of dislocation
by interstitial hydrogen. In detail, they compared the impact
of illuminated annealing and dark annealing on dislocation
passivation, and found that illuminated annealing can increase
the passivation extent of dislocation in cast mono-like silicon,
which is due to that illuminated annealing changes the charge
state of interstitial hydrogen into H[0] and H[−]. GB is another
typical type of crystallographic defects that can be passivated by hydrogen. It is found that the passivation effectiveness of GB by hydrogen strongly depends on the GB character and the contamination level. For instance, Bardhadi et al

[23] reported that hydrogen is more effective for the passivation of small angle GB as compared to large angle GB, as
large angle GB typically has a strong ability to getter impurities into it. In terms of contamination level, GB passivation
by hydrogen is normally more effective for clean GB as compared to the contaminated counterpart. It was demonstrated by
Park et al [24] that hydrogenation can decrease the density of
dangling bonds in clean GB by a factor of between three and
an order of magnitude. In contrast, hydrogenation on GB decorated with metallic impurity was much weaker as reported
by Jiang et al [25]. It was found that the density of the contaminated GB states varied only slightly after hydrogenation.
Hydrogenation is also able to passivate various kinds of metal
impurities in crystalline silicon. For instance, Jones et al [26]
reported hydrogenation of nickel impurity in crystalline silicon. Moreover, Cu, Ag, Au and Pt are reported to be effectively passivated by interstitial hydrogen [27]. Recently, it was
found that hydrogen plays an important role on the permanent deactivation of B–O related defects. In detail, Nampalli
_et al [28] experimentally confirmed that the permanent deac-_
tivation of B–O related defects can only occur with the presence of hydrogen in silicon bulk. Furthermore, Wilking et al

[29] reported that uncharged H[0] is directly responsible for
the permanent passivation of B–O related defects and therefore the regeneration rate is dependent on the concentration of
uncharged H[0] rather than the total concentration of monatomic
hydrogen in silicon. Hydrogen can not only passivate defects,
but also can induce defects in crystalline silicon. Recently,
it was widely reported that hydrogen is responsible for the
formation and activation of LeTID defect in crystalline silicon

[30]. Except for LeTID defect, Hamer et al [31] demonstrated
that hydrogen can deactivate the phosphorus atoms or counterdope in the contact region to increase the contact resistance of
the electrode when multi-crystalline silicon solar cells were
subject to a post-firing annealing. In summary, hydrogenation finds huge applications in deactivating/passivating diverse
defects in crystalline silicon and more details are provided in
section 3.


Hydrogenation is vital not only due to the ability of hydrogen to passivate almost all of typical defects in crystalline silicon, but also due to the ability of hydrogenation to significantly improve the efficiency and the open circuit voltage of the
commercial solar cells (e.g. PERC) and the next-generation
solar cells (e.g. TOPCon and SHJ). It was demonstrated by
Ciesla et al [32] that a hydrogenation process applied at the
step of metal sintering was able to enhance the efficiency
of PERC solar cells by more than 0.2% absolute. Furthermore, Liu et al [33] modified the refractive index of hydrogen containing films to enhance the hydrogen in-diffusion to
the silicon bulk, which enables a high efficiency of 23.22%
achieved on n-type cast-mono silicon PERC solar cells. For
the next-generation n-type TOPCon or SHJ solar cells, the
efficiency enhancement by hydrogenation is more significant.
For example, Madumelu et al [34] reported that an illuminated
annealing process, which should induce enhanced hydrogenation of silicon surface, could enhance the efficiency of SHJ
solar cells by more than 0.2% absolute. Furthermore, according to the authors’ experimental results, a post-firing hydrogenation step achieved by current injection at low temperature can enhance the efficiency of TOPCon solar cells by
0.4% absolute, which will be published in another paper soon.
Wright et al [35, 36] also summarized the recent studies on
hydrogenation application in SHJ solar cells in a recent review
paper, which demonstrated that appropriate surface passivation improvement by hydrogen combined with the optimization of carrier transport in n-type silicon can enhance efficiency by 0.7% absolute. In summary, hydrogenation is vital
for the conventional and the next generation silicon solar
cells due to its strong ability to enhance their efficiency.
More details on hydrogenation applications are provided in
section 4.

**2. Fundamental properties of hydrogen in**
**crystalline silicon**

_2.1. Diverse forms of hydrogen_

After the introduction of hydrogen into the crystalline silicon,
hydrogen can exist in several forms, including hydrogen platelet, hydrogen dimer, interstitial hydrogen and hydrogen bound
state. First of all, interstitial hydrogen is an important form
of hydrogen in crystalline silicon, as it is chemically active
to passivate various kinds of defects. At high temperatures
above 900 _[◦]C, almost all the hydrogen is in the form of intersti-_
tial hydrogen. Nevertheless, the fraction of interstitial hydrogen decreases rapidly with the decreased temperature. When
the temperature is below 100 _[◦]C, interstitial hydrogen only_
accounts for a small fraction of total hydrogen concentration,
as most of interstitial hydrogen will bond to dopants/defects or
form dimers. As interstitial hydrogen is chemically active, it
is crucial to make full use of interstitial hydrogen to passivate
diverse defects. In this decade, a newly developed advanced
hydrogenation technique takes advantage of interstitial hydrogen charge state control to improve hydrogenation performance, as certain charged defects typically require negatively

charged hydrogen to passivate. More information on hydrogen charge state can be found in section 2.2.

Second, hydrogen can be in a bound state, for instance


bound to dopants, or metallic impurities, or silicon dangling
bonds. Hydrogen-dopant complex is widely reported and studied, which are typically H–B and H–P complexes in conventional silicon solar cells. Recent study [37] suggested that
H–Ga complex also existed in gallium doped crystalline silicon and had a higher formation energy as compared to H–B
complex. More details of hydrogen-dopant complex are in
section 3.1. In addition, the hydrogen-metallic impurity complexes are widely reported including H–Fe complex, H–Pt
complex, H–Ti complex, H–V complex, H–Cr complex and
etc. More details about H-metallic impurity complexes are in
section 3.2. H-dangling bond complex is very common in crystalline silicon, it exists in the hydrogen passivated silicon surface, dislocation and GB [38]. H-dangling bond complex is
typically very stable against the illumination and the modest temperature, but carrier injection is able to lower its binding energy. More details on H-dangling bond complex can be
found in sections 3.3–3.5.

Third, hydrogen is able to form dimers in crystalline sil
icon. In a recent paper, Voronkov et al [39] found that there
exists three kinds of hydrogen dimers in crystalline silicon
after the co-firing process, which is named as H2A (one metastable hydrogen dimer structure), H2B (one stable hydrogen
dimer structure) and H2C (another metastable hydrogen dimer
structure) [15], respectively. Just after firing the hydrogenated
silicon nitride film, H2A dominates the total hydrogen concentration, however, it will convert to H–B complex under
dark annealing at the moderate temperatures (100 _[◦]C–350_ _[◦]C)._
H2B is a metastable dimer with a high diffusivity created by
quenching. Up to date, the pairing reaction of H2B cannot be
specified yet, but most likely it involves a reaction of atomic
hydrogen with H–B complex. H2C is a stable dimer with a low
diffusivity that is created during the exposure to a plasma, then
in-diffuses from the surface, and also can be generated in the
sample bulk. Furthermore, H2C can be produced by annealing
samples quenched from high T. The pairing reaction to create
H2C is most likely H[+]+ HB → H2C + B[−] + 2 h[+]. The conversion of H–B complex to H2A and H2C dimers by annealing
can somewhat be seen via figure 1. By the way, the authors
hypothesized that H2A and H2C might play an important role
on the kinetics of LeTID reaction, which will be discussed in
section 3.6.

Fourth, hydrogen is able to form platelets at the silicon sur
face when silicon sample is processed with hydrogen plasma
treatment. In the literature, Nickel et al [40] found that hydrogen induced platelets can only form for the Fermi-level positions of EC−EF < 0.3 eV and confirmed that the formation of
hydrogen-induced platelets is solely controlled by the Fermi
energy, as shown in figure 2. In terms of the mechanism, the
authors claimed that the nucleation of hydrogen-induced platelets requires positively (H[+]) and negatively charged hydrogen (H[−]) atoms, and therefore platelets can nucleate and grow
only when the Fermi energy is equal to the mean value of the
hydrogen donor and acceptor levels. In addition, the microscopic structure of hydrogen-induced platelets is still unknown

according to the literature. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that
hydrogen introduced from the hydrogenated silicon nitride
film through the well-known co-firing step is as well able to
induce platelets underneath the silicon surface [42].

In summary, hydrogen can exist in several forms in crys
talline silicon, including hydrogen platelet, hydrogen dimer,
interstitial hydrogen and hydrogen bound state. Different
forms of hydrogen have distinct electrical properties and may
interact with different defects. For hydrogenation, interstitial hydrogen is the most significant as it is chemically active to passivate defects. Other forms of hydrogen are important as well since they can influence the effectiveness of
hydrogenation.

_2.2. Charge states of interstitial hydrogen_


Interstitial hydrogen is significant to hydrogenation as it is
chemically active to passivate diverse defects. Studies by
Herring et al [15] pointed out that interstitial hydrogen has
three charge states, namely H[+] (positively charged), H[−] (negatively charged) and H[0] (neutral). These three charge states
of hydrogen (briefed as hydrogen for interstitial hydrogen in
the later part) have distinct configurations and electrical properties in crystalline silicon. Typically, H[+] possesses the bond
center position, midway between two silicon atoms. Whereas
H[−] possesses the interstitial position of tetrahedral site. For
H[0], it has two possible positions at the bond center position
or at the interstitial position of tetrahedral site, which corresponds to the H[0] transformed from H[+] and H[−], respectively.
Hydrogen can introduce two energy levels in silicon bandgap,
of which one is a donor level positioned at Ec − 0.16 eV [15]
and another one is an acceptor level positioned at Ev + 0.48 eV

[15], as shown in equations (1) and (2):

**_ED = EC −_** **0.16 eV** (1)

**_EA = EV + 0.48 eV._** (2)

As the donor level of hydrogen is above the acceptor level

of hydrogen in silicon bandgap, hydrogen is an impurity with
negative-U property, which means that H[0] can never be a dominant hydrogen specie. Deriving from the energy levels of
hydrogen, the fractional concentrations of various hydrogen
charge states as a function of the Fermi energy can be illustrated by figure 3 in the condition of thermal equilibrium. As
seen in figure 3, the minority charge states of hydrogen (for
instance H[0] and H[−] in p-type silicon) are typically in very low
concentration in conventional p-type and n-type silicon wafers
at room temperature. Nevertheless, carrier injection is able to
enhance the fractional concentration of the minority hydrogen charge state significantly, and hence improve the effectiveness of hydrogenation. For example, Sun et al [42] studied
the impacts of carrier injection on the concentration of H[0] via
using the model of Sah-Shockley statistics, which can be well
revealed by figure 4. In their paper, the concentration of H[0]

is positively correlated with the performance of hydrogenation. More details on hydrogen charge state modulation can
be found in the review paper by Hallam et al [43].

It is worth noting that manipulation of hydrogen charge

state plays a significant role on enhancing the effectiveness of defect passivation. For instance, as mentioned in the
introduction, H[0] has the faster diffusivity about five orders of


**Figure 3. Fractional hydrogen charge state concentrations of**
interstitial hydrogen in silicon in thermal equilibrium at room
temperature as a function of the Fermi level (EFermi) relative to the

magnitude over H[−] and H[+] at 423 K, and therefore can be
vital in passivating defects during the fast-firing process. In
terms of the reactivity, Liu et al [14] reported that the hydrogenation of interstitial iron in crystalline silicon can be dramatically enhanced by taking advantage of H[−] and H[0]. Furthermore, Hallam et al [44] successfully used laser to enhance
the concentration of H[0] to accelerate the regeneration rate of
B–O related defects. More applications of hydrogen charge
state control on improving defect passivation can be found in
sections 3.1–3.6.

In summary, hydrogen has three charge states in crystalline

silicon, namely H[+], H[−] and H[0]. The fractional concentration
of these three charge states depends on the position of Fermi
level in silicon bandgap. As the Fermi level approaches to the
conduction band, the H[−] dominates over all the interstitial
hydrogen. Whereas the Fermi level approaches to the valence
band, the H[+] dominates. Hydrogen can introduce two energy
levels in silicon bandgap at Ec − 0.16 eV (donor level) and
_Ev + 0.48 eV (acceptor level). As the donor level of hydrogen_
is above the acceptor level, hydrogen is a negative-U impurity, which means that H[0] can never be a dominant hydrogen
specie. In addition, hydrogen charge states play an important
role on hydrogen electrical properties. Recent works demonstrated that manipulation of hydrogen charge states can significantly improve the hydrogenation performance.

_2.3. Solubility of hydrogen in silicon_

The solubility of hydrogen typically refers to the solubility of
interstitial hydrogen in crystalline silicon. Hydrogen (refers
to interstitial hydrogen in this section) can dissolve in crystalline silicon as isolated hydrogen atom and its solubility
strongly depends on temperature. For instance, McQuaid et al

[45] reported that the solubility of hydrogen at 1300 _[◦]C was_
1.5 × 10[16] cm[−][3]. Binns et al [7] further extended the data


-----

J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 55 (2022) 453002 Topical Review

exposure can improve the solubility of hydrogen in crystalline silicon, as voids in the surface damage layer provide the
space for hydrogen to accumulate. Nevertheless, it is worth
noting that the accumulated hydrogen in voids is not necessarily to be the dissolved hydrogen and can be the hydrogen
dimers and so on.

In summary, the solubility of hydrogen in crystalline silicon

depends on temperature, the interaction with dopants, the void
concentration and etc. At high temperatures above 900 _[◦]C, the_
solubility of hydrogen follows equation (3). However, at low
temperatures below 900 _[◦]C, the solubility of hydrogen should_
be below the above trend due to the interaction with dopants.

_2.4. Diffusivity of hydrogen_

The diffusivity of hydrogen in crystalline silicon was extensively studied by researchers. Wieringen et al [8] first derived
the hydrogen diffusivity at high temperatures ranging from
1243 to 1473 K, as expressed in equation (4). At such
high temperatures, hydrogen dominantly exist in the form
of interstitial hydrogen, and hence this extracted diffusivity
data is typically considered as the upper limit for hydrogen
diffusivity:

**_DH = 9.4 × 10[−][3]_** **exp** _−0.48 eV kT[−][1][)]_ **cm[2]** **s[−][1].** (4)

(

At intermediate temperatures ranging from 702 to 1073 K,


many controversial results on hydrogen diffusivity were reported with the maximum difference about five orders of magnitude at a fixed temperature. This difference is mainly due to
the fact that the hydrogen diffusivity, at this temperature range,
can be significantly influenced by the internal electric field,
the interaction with dopants and other defects and etc [46]. A
comprehensive discussion of discrepancies on hydrogen diffusivity data in this temperature range is given in the [43].
Furthermore, Hallam et al [43] also summarized the hydrogen
diffusivity data from the literature, which is shown in figure 5.
It is worth noting that at this temperature range, the hydrogen diffusivity is dominated by the diffusivity of interstitial
hydrogen, as other forms of hydrogen diffuse very slowly as
compared to the interstitial hydrogen.

At low temperatures ranging from 300 to 473 K, hydrogen

transport in silicon is not dominated by atomic hydrogen, but
by a mix of the diffusion of hydrogen dimers and the diffusion of excess hydrogen atoms, as reported by Saad et al [47].
It is found that hydrogen transport at these temperatures consisted of a fast diffusion specie, which is considered as excess
interstitial hydrogen atoms in different charge states, and a
slow diffusion specie, which is considered as excess hydrogen
dimers or excess hydrogen-point defect complexes.

Interestingly, Kamiura et al [48] even reported hydro
gen diffusivity at the temperatures below room temperature
between 220 and 270 K, as expressed in equation (5). The
authors attributed this diffusivity to the diffusivity of H[+] or
H[0] and believed that H[0] has an activation energy of ∼0.5 eV
over a wide range of temperatures from 220 to 1473 K:

silicon at 1300 _[◦]C is 1.58 × 10[16]_ cm[−][3], which is in agreement with the [45]. It is evident that the solubility of hydrogen
reduces with the decreased temperature, and when the temperature is 900 _[◦]C, the solubility of hydrogen in crystalline silicon_
is only 1.72 × 10[14] cm[−][3]. For the temperatures below 900 _[◦]C,_
it can be expected that the solubility of hydrogen will continuously decrease with the reducing temperature. Nevertheless,
as far as the authors know, no hydrogen solubility data at low
temperature is reported in the literature, possibly due to the
detection limit of the characterization tools. However, it can be
speculated that the solubility of hydrogen at low temperatures
should be significantly below the trend of the equation (3) due
to the interactions of hydrogen with dopants. In addition, some
researchers [9] reported that surface damage due to plasma

forming gas annealing [52], firing the hydrogenated silicon
nitride (SiNx:H) [41], and chemical cleaning/etching [53, 54].
Noted that, firing the SiNx:H film to release hydrogen into
crystalline silicon is widely used as the hydrogen source in
photovoltaic industry. The reasons are three folds: (1) the
SiNx:H film is a suitable anti-reflection coating due to the combination of good optical transparency and the tunable reflective
index of the film; (2) the SiNx:H film is an excellent surface
passivation layer and (3) the SiNx:H film can easily achieve
silicon bulk passivation during the firing process. Other hydrogen sources have some disadvantages for their application in
commercial solar cells. For example, hydrogen plasma and
hydrogen ion implantation can introduce hydrogen atoms into
crystalline silicon at a relative low temperature, but they can
cause crystalline damage due to the high energy of the bombardment of hydrogen atoms from the equipment [55, 56].
Forming gas annealing will not cause crystalline damages, but
it must be conducted at a relative high temperature exceeding 900 _[◦]C [57]. Chemical cleaning/etching is conducted at a_
low temperature below 100 _[◦]C and will not cause crystalline_
damage, but it can only introduce hydrogen into the surface
of crystalline silicon roughly within 3 µm of silicon surface

[58]. In this paper, we mainly introduce the SiNx:H film as the
hydrogen source due to its wide applications in industry.

The hydrogen within the SiNx:H film is dominantly bonded

to the silicon atom or the nitride atom via the Si–H bond or the
N–H bond. To detect them, it can typically use FTIR with the
vibration frequency of the Si–H bond at ∼2000–2250 cm[−][1]

and the N–H bond at roughly 3340 cm[−][1] and ∼3450 cm[−][1]

[59]. The release of hydrogen from the film is associated
with a reconstruction of the film by the following reactions
in equations (6) and (7):

**Si −** **H** (s) + 4N − **H2 (s) →** **Si −** **N** (s) + 3N − **H3 (g)** (6)

**_Si −_** **_H_** (s) + N − **_H_** (s) → **_Si −_** **_N_** (s) + H2 (g) _._ (7)

When the hydrogen is released, the Si atom will form a

bond with the N atom, resulting in the densification of the
SiNx:H film. This is reflected in the FTIR absorption spectra
with an enhancement in the Si–N peak (∼700–1020 cm[−][1], and
with a reduction in the Si–H and N–H peaks at roughly 2250
and 3300 cm[−][1], respectively) [60].

It is important to distinguish the silicon rich SiNx:H film

and the nitride rich SiNx:H film, as they have distinct properties regarding to hydrogen. It was found that the silicon rich
SiNx:H film contains more hydrogen in the as-deposited condition, however, after firing most of hydrogen escapes out of
the SiNx:H film as hydrogen molecules due to the less dense
film [61]. The nitride rich SiNx:H film contains less hydrogen,
but most of hydrogen can diffuse into crystalline silicon in its
atomic form due to the denser film [61]. Typically as reported
in the literature [62, 63], the silicon sample coated with the
silicon rich SiNx:H film has a better minority carrier lifetime
in the as-deposited condition, whereas Si/N equal SiNx:H film
can achieve the highest lifetime enhancement after firing. As
an example, Chen et al [64] demonstrated the hydrogen content and the implied open circuit voltage (iVoc) of the silicon

Importantly, it should be mentioned that hydrogen charge

state plays an important role on interstitial hydrogen diffusivity. Theoretically, due to the coulomb attraction, the majority
charge state of interstitial hydrogen will be attracted by ionized
dopants at the moderate temperature range, leading to a lower
diffusivity value. As evidences, Johnson et al [49] reported an
activation energy of ∼0.5 eV for H[+] and ∼1.1 eV for H[−] in
n-type (phosphorus doped) silicon sample, which has a good
agreement with the reported activation energies for hydrogen
diffusion without trap limiting effect and with that, respectively. It also easily implies that H[0] should have a better diffusivity as it is not affected by electric field. In experiment,
Kamiura et al [30] reported an enhanced diffusivity of H[0] over
H[+] and H[−] at 423 K about five orders of magnitude larger.
More information regarding to the activation energies of various hydrogen charge state is well presented in [43].

In summary, hydrogen diffusivity depends on many factors,

including temperature, the form of hydrogen, charge states
of interstitial hydrogen, electric field, the interaction with
dopants and etc. At high temperatures above 1073 K, hydrogen diffusivity is determined by the diffusivity of interstitial
hydrogen without any trap. At intermediate temperatures ranging from 702 to 1073 K, hydrogen still diffuses in the form of
interstitial hydrogen, but its diffusivity is dramatically reduced
by the interactions with dopants and defects. At low temperatures ranging from 300 to 473 K, hydrogen transport is dominantly in the form of hydrogen dimers and its diffusivity is
very slow. In addition, hydrogen charge states play an important role on interstitial hydrogen diffusivity. It is reported that
H[0] can diffuse faster than H[−] and H[+] about five orders of
magnitude at 423 K.

_2.5. Hydrogen source_

Although hydrogen can be introduced into crystalline silicon
by hydrogen plasma [50], hydrogen ion implantation [51],

the hydrogen content in SiNx:H film. Typically, the refractive
index equal to 2 would be chosen for optimal anti-reflection
property and good bulk passivation. Firing temperature also
plays an important role on hydrogenation of silicon bulk with
the best value at about 750 _[◦]C._

**3. Applications of hydrogenation on**
**deactivating/inducing defects**

In section 2, the dominant properties of hydrogen in crystalline silicon are reviewed. In this section, we will expend
the knowledge of hydrogenation on the mechanisms of how
hydrogen passivates various kinds of defects for promoting the
efficiency of silicon solar cells.

sample coated with the different SiNx:H films at as-deposited
condition and after firing. In detail, it was believed that the
extent of bulk passivation is not related to the content of hydrogen within the SiNx:H film, but is instead associated with the
in-diffusion of the atomic hydrogen to silicon bulk [65, 66]. It
was found, experimentally, that high atomic density and high
thermal stability of the SiNx:H film are key factors in determining the degree of bulk passivation achieved [59, 64]. Furthermore, the high thermal stability of the SiNx:H film is also significant to achieve high quality surface passivation as reported in

[66]. In addition, the silicon rich and nitride rich SiNx:H films
respond quite differently to the different firing temperatures in
terms of the hydrogen desorption rate as shown in figure 6. It
can conclude from figure 6 that the silicon rich SiNx:H film is
able to release hydrogen at the relative low temperatures.

Firing temperature, during which hydrogen is released from

the SiNx:H film, also plays a significant role on bulk passivation. For example, Yelundur et al [67] reported that different
firing temperatures resulted in different lifetime enhancement
factor for p-type string ribbon silicon, with the best performance enhancement occurring at the firing temperature of
around 750 _[◦]C. Besides, Hameiri et al [68] investigated the_
effects of different firing temperatures on boosting the lifetime of Czochralsik silicon (Cz-Si) (non-specified wafer type
in that paper) and found a similar trend with Yelundur et al.
The reason is possibly that the firing temperature of around
750 _[◦]C can result in a maximum fractional concentration of_
H[0] in crystalline silicon during firing. In addition, the cooling
rate of the firing process is critical to the performance of hydrogenation. For instance, Song et al [69] demonstrated that fast
cooling rate and cooling with illumination can both promote
the bulk hydrogenation performance.

In summary, the hydrogenated silicon nitride film (SiNx:H)

is the typical hydrogen source for crystalline silicon solar cells.
The refractive index of SiNx:H film can be modulated to vary


_3.1. Dopant deactivation_

Hydrogen is widely reported to be able to deactivate dopants.
This can be advantageous if dopant density is too high to fabricate silicon solar cells with a reasonable efficiency. Experiments have found that the hydrogenation of dopant atoms
will lead to a reduction in the free carrier concentration, but
an increase in Hall mobility [70]. A model of hydrogenation
of shallow dopants suggested that for boron–hydrogen pairs,
the atomic hydrogen has bond center site geometry; and for
phosphorus–hydrogen pairs, the atomic hydrogen has antibonding site geometry, due to the fact that the system needs
to maintain the lowest energy geometry [70].

The schematic diagrams showing the bond structures of the

H–B and H–P pairs are illustrated in figures 7 and 8.

In more detail, Chang et al [20] calculated H-dopant form
ation and dissociation energies as illustrated in figure 9, from
which it is found that the dissociation energies are estimated to
be roughly 0.1 eV and 0.6 eV for the H–P and H–B complexes,
respectively. This result indicates that atomic hydrogen binds
tighter with the boron atoms than the phosphorus atoms, and
therefore it is relative difficult to achieve a large fraction of
phosphorus–hydrogen pairs in n-type silicon material.

It is worth noting that hydrogen-dopant complex is not

stable at high temperature. In experiment, it was reported that
at a temperature of around 473 K, reactivation of boron atoms
will happen [71]. In addition, it is found [71] that carrier injection can accelerate the reactivation of boron atoms by converting H[+] to H[0] and then H[0] diffuses away from the boron atoms.
The reports on the H–P complex are less, but the basic mechanism should be the same with the H–B complex.

Gallium-hydrogen (Ga–H) complex should exist in crystal
line silicon, however, few reports studied the Ga–H complex
in crystalline silicon. As far as the authors know, Lin et al [37]
reported that Ga–H complex can act as the hydrogen source
for the subsequent LeTID degradation in gallium doped PERC
solar cells. Moreover, Kwapil et al [72] found that the different LeTID kinetics in gallium doped silicon was due to the
different property of Ga–H complex.

In summary, hydrogen is able to deactivate dopants in crys
talline silicon like boron and phosphorus. However, dopant-H

complex is not stable, it can dissociate at elevated temperatures and under carrier injection.

_3.2. Passivation of metallic impurity_

Metallic impurities are common recombination centers in
crystalline silicon, which are able to significantly reduce the
efficiency of solar cells [73, 74]. Hydrogen is able to passivate
most of metallic impurities in crystalline silicon and therefore
attracted intense interest from researchers. Generally, hydrogenation of metallic impurity can eliminate the defect energy
level induced by the metallic impurity or make it a shallow
energy level.

One typical metallic impurity in crystalline silicon that can

be hydrogenated is iron. For instance, Liu et al [17] reported
that the concentrations of dissolved interstitial iron in p-type
mc-Si wafers which covered with SiNx:H films were reduced
by more than 90% after a 30 min anneal at the temperatures
between 600 _[◦]C and 900_ _[◦]C due to the formation of Fe–H com-_
plex, with the most effective reduction occurring at 700 _[◦]C, at_
which 99% of the initial dissolved iron is hydrogenated after
30 min. The mechanism is proposed to be the pairing of positively charged iron with negatively charged hydrogen, forming
less recombination active Fe–H complexes in silicon. Later,
Liu et al [75] also argued that some iron impurities might
be gettered by silicon nitride film at that temperature range.
Furthermore, Leonard et al [76] directly observed a DLTS


signal of Fe–H complex, which has a donor energy level at
_Ev + 0.31 eV. The DLTS results also indicated that the Fe–H_
complex has a temperature independent capture cross section
at 5.2 × 10[−][17] cm[2]. This relative small capture cross section
of Fe–H complex suggests that Fe–H complex has less recombination activity as compared to interstitial iron. It is worth
noting that the Fe–H complex is extremely unstable and will
dissociate completely by annealing for 30 min at 125 _[◦]C [77]._

Hydrogenation of Cu, Ag, Au and Pt in crystalline sil
icon is as well vital since these four metallic impurities are
ready to induce significant recombination in silicon. In the literature, Knack et al [78] used the DLTS to find the energy
levels of the Cu–H complex. Two deep levels at Ec − 0.36 eV
and Ev + 0.54 eV were attributed to the Cu–H1 complex
and a third charge state of this defect might be overlapping
with the Cu donor energy level at Ev + 0.21 eV. For the
complex of Cu–H2, two energy levels at Ec − 0.25 eV and
_Ev + 0.27 eV were assigned. The authors also claimed that a_
passive hydrogen-copper complex can be formed, which contains three or more hydrogen atoms. Moreover, Einar et al

[65] investigated the energy levels of Au–H complex via DLTS
and found that Au and hydrogen can form two separate complexes, namely Au–H1 complex and Au–H2 complex. The Au–
H1 complex is electrically active and has three deep levels
at Ec − 0.19 eV, Ev + 0.21 eV and Ev + 0.47 eV, respectively. In contrast, the Au–H2 complex is electrically inactive. In addition, the authors found that the Au–H2 complex
dominated in the hydrogen rich region, whereas the Au–H1
complex was present in hydrogen lean region. Furthermore,
Yarykin et al [66] studied the Ag–H complexes in crystalline silicon by DLTS. In detail, the Ag–H1 complex introduces

three energy levels in the bandgap, which are EC − 0.45 eV,
_EC −_ 0.09 eV and EV + 0.28 eV, respectively. The Ag–H2
complex processes two energy levels at EC − 0.5 eV and
_EV + 0.38 eV, respectively. The electrically inactive Ag–H_
complex includes at least three hydrogen atoms and can be
annealed out at roughly 450 _[◦]C. Overall, the energy levels_
of Cu, Ag, Au and their complexes with hydrogen are listed
in table 1 and illustrated in figure 10. At last, Sachse et al

[79] reported four platinum-hydrogen related deep levels identified at EC − 0.18 eV, EC − 0.50 eV, EV + 0.30 eV and
_EV + 0.40 eV by DLTS, respectively. These levels belong_
to at least three different platinum-hydrogen complexes and
all of them are electrically active. Nevertheless, the exact
number of hydrogen in the platinum-hydrogen complex for
each energy level is not identified in that paper. Moreover,
according to the above results, it can hypothesize that multiple H-metal impurity complex is more likely to be passive and the method to incorporate multiple hydrogen into
the complex would be a hydrogen rich environment for the
reaction.

Some other metallic impurities can interact with hydro
gen as well in crystalline silicon, although they might play a
less important role on the electrical quality of silicon wafer.


To make the paper brief, the energy levels of these metallic
impurities and their complexes with hydrogen are summarized
in figure 11 [80].

It is worth noting that metallic impurities and hydrogen can

exhibit different charge states and electrical properties in nand p-type crystalline silicon and even with different dopants
such as with Ga. Typically the interstitial hydrogen with a different charge state to metallic impurities can deactivate them
better [80]. Furthermore, different dopants might change the
activation energy required for the hydrogenation of the metallic impurities.

In summary, hydrogen is able to passivate diverse metal
lic impurities in crystalline silicon. Typically, hydrogenmetal impurity complex is still recombination active with one
hydrogen in the complex, but with more hydrogen attaching to the metallic impurity the complex becomes recombination inactive with no defect energy level in silicon
bandgap.

_3.3. Passivation of extended defects_

Extended defects are detrimental to silicon solar cells, as they
are able to reduce minority carrier lifetime and induce shunt
paths across the p–n junction [81, 82]. In the worst case,
metallic impurities can segregate into the extended defects
to enhance their recombination activity [83]. In experiment,
Sopori et al [84] demonstrated that dislocation clusters in back
surface field silicon solar cells can lead to an efficiency loss of
more than 3–4 absolute percentage points.

Hydrogen is able to effectively passivate extended defects

in multi- and cast-mono crystalline silicon wafers [85]. In previous reports, Dube and Hanoka [81] reported that hydrogen
was able to passivate dislocations for depths up to 250 µm in
string ribbon silicon. Furthermore, Weronek et al [86] reported the hydrogenation of the extended defects-related D-Band
luminescence in silicon. In detail, it was found that hydrogenation at 300 _[◦]C are able to reduce the D1 and D4 band_
intensities but increase the intensities of the D2 and D3 bands.
In the paper, the D1 and D2 bands are assigned to a recombination at the stacking fault between relaxed partials and the
D4 band is assigned to the zero-phonon transition of a localized state at the dislocation and the D3 band is assigned to
the momentum conserving TO-phonon replica of the D4 band.
Furthermore, it is reported that hydrogenation of extended
defects can be enhanced by an additional illuminated annealing process. For instance, Song et al [80] demonstrated that
a post-firing annealing at 350 _[◦]C and 9.6 × 10[18]_ photons
cm[−][2] s[−][1] illumination intensity for 4 min can dramatically
enhance the passivation effectiveness of extended defects by
hydrogen, of which the LBIC maps before and after the treatment are shown in figure 12. This result indicates that a short
firing process is not sufficient to completely passivate extended defects.

Although hydrogen is able to passivate extended defects,

the effectiveness of passivation depends on some key factors.
The first key factor is whether the extended defects are decorated with metallic impurity or not. In the literature, Martinuzzi
_et al [21] found that there exists two types of defects associated_

with the extended defects in silicon, namely deep level defects
and shallow level defects. It is reported that the shallow level
defects could be completely passivated by hydrogen, whereas
deep level defects were transformed into shallow one after
hydrogenation. We hypothesize that the shallow level defects
might be associated with the part of extended defects without
metallic impurity decoration, whereas the deep level defects
might be associated with the part of extended defects with
metallic impurity decoration. The experimental observations
of deep and shallow level defects are shown in figure 13. It
is evident that deep level defects appear in room temperature (300 K) LBIC scan map, whereas shallow level defects
appear in low temperature (100 K) LBIC scan map. Furthermore, figure 14 reveals the different response of hydrogenation
on deep level defects and shallow level defects. Please note
that the LBIC contrast (C) is defined according to equation (8),


based on the electron-beam induced current scan maps by the
ratio:

**_C = 1 −_** **_Idef/I0._** (8)

where Idef is the current collected at a defect and I0 is the background current. By the comparison of figures 14(a) with (b), it
shows that some part of extended defects are well passivated
by hydrogen and this part is assigned to shallow level defects,
whereas other part of extended defects cannot be passivated by
hydrogen and are assigned to deep level defects. To get more
insight on the influence of metallic impurity on hydrogenation of extended defects, we review the reports from Kittler
_et al [87]. It is found that metallic impurities accommodated_
in the extended defects core cannot be hydrogenated, whereas
the metallic impurities in the cloud surrounding the extended

defects are weakly bound and can be passivated by hydrogen.
In our opinion, we interpret this result as that the metallic silicide are strongly bound and cannot be passivated by hydrogen,
whereas the metallic precipitates around the extended defects
can be passivated by hydrogen.

In addition, the second key factor is the hydrogenation con
ditions. For instance, Rinio et al [88] compared the effectiveness of hydrogenation of extended defects via the methods of either firing the SiNx:H layer or applying a microwave
induced remote hydrogen plasma (MIRHP). As a conclusion,
firing the SiNx:H layer has better hydrogenation performance
than MIRHP, but the best performance was achieved by the
combination of these two methods. It can conjecture from
this result that some defects in extended defects require high
temperature to trigger hydrogenation, which corresponds to a
high activation energy of this reaction, whereas other defects
in extended defects require a relative long time to deactivate it due to the low reaction rate. Therefore it is crucial


to carefully manipulate temperature and time to effectively
passivate extended defects by hydrogen. In addition, Ciesla
_et al [22] found that the illuminated annealing, which boosts_
the fractional concentrations of H[0] and H[−], can dramatically enhance the performance of hydrogenation on extended
defects in p-type cast mono-like silicon, as compared to dark
annealing.

In summary, hydrogen is able to passivate extended defects

in crystalline silicon, but its effectiveness depends on two key
factors: the contamination level and the hydrogenation conditions. Therefore, careful manipulation of hydrogenation conditions and pre-gettering step are vital for maximizing the performance of hydrogenation on extended defects.

_3.4. Passivation of grain boundary_

cast-mono crystalline silicon. In general theory, GB can be

classified into two categories: small angle (SA) GB with misorientation angle <15[◦] and large angle (LA) GB with misorientation angle ≧15[◦].

For more details of SA GB, Mao et al [89] provided some

information about its recombination activity. They investigated the recombination activities of SA GB in cast mono silicon (CM–Si) and found that the recombination activity of SA
GB increased with the mis-orientation angle and saturated at
the mis-orientation angle above 0.7[◦], as shown in figure 15.
The reason is hypothesized that the dislocation density associated with the SA GB increased with the mis-orientation angle
and so did the dangling bonds inside the SA GB until 0.7[◦].

For LA GB, the recombination activity of LA GB is weak

when it is in low contamination level. Nevertheless, when the
LA GB is contaminated with metallic impurity heavily, LA
GB shows a strong recombination activity. Nevertheless, it is
worth noting that typically LA GB has a strong ability to getter
metallic impurities into it and therefore induce strong recombination activity.

Hydrogenation is an effective way to passivate GB, but the

passivation mechanisms vary dramatically to different defects
in GB. In the literature, it is reported that both impurity contamination level and the GB character can strongly influence
the hydrogenation mechanisms on GB. To get insight into
the mechanism, the authors reviewed lots of reports in the


literature and concluded three assumptions for the hydrogenation of GB.

(a) Dangling bonds in GB can be well passivated by hydrogen

by removing its defect energy level out of silicon bandgap.

(b) Metallic silicide inside GB cannot be passivated by

hydrogen.

(c) Metallic precipitates in the GB core can be passivated by

hydrogen in terms of transforming its defect energy level
from deep to shallow.

To find the evidences to support these three assumptions,

we conclude the following reports from the literature.

(a) Dangling bonds in GB can be well passivated by hydrogen

by removing its defect energy level out of silicon bandgap

Johnson et al [38] provided the direct evidence to support

the fact that hydrogen is able to passivate the dangling bonds
in GB via using the characterization tool of electron-spin resonance. After hydrogenation, it is found that the passivated
dangling bonds in GB are no longer active. In addition, Chen
_et al [90] found the evidence that hydrogen can completely_
passivate the dangling bonds in GB. They demonstrated that

the multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers with low Fe contamination can be well passivated by hydrogen, leading to
that the EBIC contrast decreased about 75%–80% for the Σ
(Σ = 3, 9, and 27) GBs and decreased about 35%–40% for the
small angle (SA) and random angle (RA) GBs. As the impurity contamination level is low, it is reasonable to assume that
the 75%–80% reduction of EBIC contrast in the Σ (Σ = 3, 9,
and 27) GBs is due to the hydrogenation of clean dangling
bonds. Other researchers reported some evidences as well.
For instance, Park et al [24] reported that hydrogenation can
reduce the density of dangling bonds in clean GB by about
a sevenfold. In addition, Maydell et al [91] confirmed that
hydrogen can terminate the dangling bonds in GB to dramatically reduce the GB recombination activity. Nevertheless, no
DLTS result is available to reveal the elimination of the defect
energy level of dangling bonds in GB by hydrogen.

(b) Metallic silicide inside GB cannot be passivated by

hydrogen

Although GB can be passivated by hydrogen, the recombin
ation activity of some parts in GB still exists after hydrogenation. Subjecting to this observation, the authors hypothesize
that the metallic silicide in GB cannot be passivated by hydrogen. Some reports in the literature can support this assumption. For example, Chen et al [90] demonstrated that even after
efficient hydrogenation, all types of GB exist some recombination activity, indicating some defects cannot be passivated by
hydrogen. Moreover, Buonassisi et al [92] found that hydrogenation is particularly effective for random angle (RA) GB,
but is with almost no passivation effect on low coincidence
site lattice (CSL) GB, as shown in figure 16. The reason is
explained by that the RA GB has less dangling bonds and


therefore less metallic silicide is formed inside it, whereas low
CSL GB contains more dangling bonds and therefore more
metallic silicide inside it. As the metallic silicide cannot be
passivated by hydrogen, the hydrogenation performance on
the low CSL GB would be low. Furthermore, Yu et al [93]
found an interesting result that hydrogenation can reduce the
density of GB states, but cannot significantly influence the distributions of its defect energy levels and the associated carrier capture cross-sections, which suggests that hydrogen can
only passivate clean dangling bonds, but cannot deactivate the
metallic silicide in the GB core.

(c) Metallic precipitates in the GB core can be passivated by

hydrogen in terms of transforming its defect energy level
from deep to shallow

Even in heavily contaminated samples, hydrogenation is

able to reduce the density of GB states to some extent. The
authors hypothesize that the metallic precipitates in the GB
can be passivated by hydrogen and after passivation the associated defect energy level is transformed from deep to shallow.
Some reports in the literature can support this assumption. For
example, Jiang et al [25] investigated the impact of hydrogenation on the electrical properties of a GB (with metallic precipitates) in the p-type direct silicon bonded wafers by using
current–voltage (I–V) and DLTS tools. It was found that the
energy distributions of interfacial states in GB after hydrogenation became shallower, and the majority carrier capture crosssection was reduced by approximately two orders of magnitude, whereas the density of GB states varied only slightly.
This phenomenon indicates that a certain defect in GB, most
likely metallic precipitates, can be partially passivated by
hydrogen by transforming its defect energy level from deep to

shallow. In addition, Martinuzzi et al [94] demonstrated that
hydrogenation indeed transformed the defect energy level of
GB from deep to shallow, indicated by the EBIC contrast (C,
defined by equation (8)) variations at 300 K and 100 K before
and after hydrogenation as illustrated in figure 17. Please note
in figure 17 that deep energy level defects dominated in 300 K
EBIC scan before hydrogenation, whereas after hydrogenation the shallow energy level defects dominated in EBIC scan
at 100 K.

In summary, GB can exhibit distinct recombination activity

due to the different GB character and the contamination level.
Hydrogen is able to effectively passivate GB, but the mechanism of hydrogenation on GB varies significantly for the different defects. To better understand hydrogenation of GB, three
assumptions are made to explain the above mechanism. These
three assumptions are: (a) dangling bonds can be completely
passivated by hydrogen by removing its defect energy level
out of silicon bandgap; (b) metallic silicide in GB cannot be
passivated by hydrogen; (c) metallic precipitates in GB can
be passivated by hydrogen in terms of transforming its defect
energy level from deep to shallow.

_3.5. Passivation of silicon surface states_

Surface passivation is another important issue for crystalline
silicon, as it can influence the efficiency of silicon solar cells
to a large extent. Typically, the silicon surface states are well
passivated by surface passivation layer or stack such as the
hydrogenated silicon nitride film or the aluminum oxide film
or the stack of them. Nevertheless, to obtain ultrahigh open circuit voltage of the cell, it is still necessary to further reduce the
density of silicon surface states by hydrogenation even after
the coating of passivation layer.

Hydrogen is able to passivate both the clean silicon sur
face states and the contaminated silicon surface states. For
instance, Leguijt et al [94] reported that the density of interface states Dit, in the clean silicon surface, can be strongly


reduced by the hydrogenation step, and a low Dit value in the
order of 10[10] cm[−][2] eV[−][1] can be obtained after hydrogenation. In addition, Hezel et al reported that the hydrogenation
step resulted in the lowest value of Dit of 8 × l0[9] cm[−][2] eV[−][1]

(at midgap), whereas as-deposited SiNx:H/Si interface showed
_Dit value between 10[11]_ and 2 × 10[12] cm[−][2] eV[−][1]. The above
observations suggest that hydrogenation can further reduce the
density of silicon surface states even after the coating of passivation layer. To find the mechanism of hydrogenation on
silicon surface states, Chris et al [95] calculated the binding
energies of various H configuration in silicon, and found that
Si–H is a relative stable bond, as shown in figure 18. Furthermore, Cartier et al [96] demonstrated that atomic hydrogen can
passivate silicon surface states, but at the meantime the Si–H
bond dissociates. They further found that the dissociation of
Si–H bond in silicon surface can be enhanced by carrier injection. For the contaminated silicon surface states, hydrogenation of them becomes a complex mechanism. In detail, Oura
_et al [97] demonstrated that the interaction of atomic hydro-_
gen with the metal-silicon sub-monolayer interfaces results in
the agglomeration of the two-dimensional metal layers into the
three-dimensional metal islands, as shown in figure 19. It is
worth noting that the phenomenon confirmed by Ag/Si system
may not fit into all metals/silicon system. Nevertheless, the literature about other metals/silicon system is relatively few.

In summary, hydrogen is able to passivate silicon surface

states both with and without contamination. For clean silicon
surface, hydrogenation can reduce the density of silicon surface states to several folds smaller. For contaminated silicon
surface, hydrogenation can result in the agglomeration of the
two-dimensional metal layers into the three-dimensional metal
islands.

_3.6. Passivation of boron–oxygen related defects_

Boron–oxygen related defects can dramatically reduce the
efficiency of boron-doped, oxygen-rich Cz-Si solar cells and

therefore get intense interest from photovoltaic researchers.
Up to date, researchers found that the B–O related defects
are made up of substitutional boron and interstitial oxygen
dimer. Light induced degradation (LID) that caused by B–O
related defects consists of a fast degradation process and a slow
degradation process and the degradation mechanism is identified as a configuration change of the B–O related defects.
Since the characteristics of the B–O related defects are not
the focus of this paper, we will only introduce the hydrogenation of B–O related defects in this section. More information
about the characteristics of B–O related defects can be found
elsewhere [98–101]. In addition, the B–O related defects can
be deactivated by two ways. One way is the dissociation of the
B–O related defects by dark annealing. Another way is to permanently passivate the B–O related defects via an illuminated
annealing process, through which the B–O related defects are
turned to a recombination inactive ‘regenerated’ state [100].
This regeneration process is the focus of this section and it
requires hydrogen to participate in [100].

To better understand the regeneration process, we start with

the introduction of three state model of B–O related defects.
Herguth et al [102] first put forward the three state model
for describing the long-term behavior of the metastable B–O
related defects in crystalline silicon, as shown in figure 20.

From the three state model, it can be seen that state B is the

degraded state and it can be transformed to state A (annealed
state) by dark annealing. The transformation from state B to
state A is also found experimentally at the conditions of elevated temperature and carrier injection, and is often called the

grown epitaxially on the H-covered Si(111) substrate. Structural
transformation between these two structures is reversible with the
adsorption and desorption of atomic hydrogen. Reprinted from

regeneration process. The transformation from state A to state
B is the typical LID process. The transformation from state
C to state B is also possible and can occur at high temperature above 200 _[◦]C, and is called the redegradation process._
Other transformations such from state A to state C and from
state C to state A are considered as impossible by Hallam et al

[103]. They studied the kinetics of the LID and regeneration
processes of B–O related defects, and found strong evidences
that no direct passivation pathway occurs for the passivation
from state A to state C. In addition, the transformation from
state C to state A can be well described by the kinetics of the


16


-----

J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 55 (2022) 453002 Topical Review


transformations from state C to state B and then from state B
to state A, therefore they considered the transformation from
state C to state A less likely.
Among all the transformations, the regeneration process
from state B to state C is of great importance. As this
transformation can permanently deactivate the B–O related
defects, which means that LID will not occur under normal field operation. The mechanism of the regeneration process is extensively studied. Typically, two hypotheses are
considered to cause the regeneration process, namely boron
nano-precipitates induced regeneration and hydrogen induced
regeneration. For the first hypothesis, Walter et al [104] suggested that boron nano-precipitate is a candidate for the regeneration process as it is known that plasma treatment can generate boron nano-precipitate in crystalline silicon and plasma
treatment is confirmed to be necessary for the regeneration
process. Nevertheless, recent work by Nampalli et al [28]
suggested that hydrogen rather than boron nano-precipitate is
more likely to be responsible for the regeneration process. The
evidence is that the regeneration process cannot occur when
the sample is subjected to the plasma treatment without hydrogen source, which can still generate boron nano-precipitate
in silicon. Whereas the regeneration process does occur with
hydrogen present in silicon bulk.
Regarding to the role of hydrogen on the regeneration of
B–O related defects, more interesting works are reported. In
detail, Wilking et al [29] studied the high-speed regeneration process and suggested that the boron–hydrogen pairs are
the hydrogen source for the regeneration reaction. Another
work by Wilking et al [29] found that uncharged H[0] is directly responsible for the permanent passivation of B–O related
defects and therefore the regeneration rate is dependent on
the concentration of uncharged H[0] rather than the total concentration of monatomic hydrogen in silicon. Recent studies
also explored the possibility of rapid regeneration process for
industrial applications, which is able to completely deactivate the B–O related defects within 10 s. For example, Wilking
_et al [29] found that temperature range of 200_ _[◦]C and 230_ _[◦]C_
at 2.7 suns can completely deactivate the B–O related defects
in less than 3 s. Furthermore, Hallam et al found that laser
can accelerate the formation of B–O related defects and subsequent permanent passivation of it, which reduced the total
processing time from approximately 170 s to 10 s.
Other studies calculated the activation energy of the regeneration process. In detail, various studies presented a wide
range of values for the activation energy of the regeneration
process, such as 0.6 eV, 0.7 eV, 1.0 eV and 1.2 eV with all the
studies claiming uncertainty ranges below 0.1 eV [105]. This
phenomenon is consistent with the hypothesis by Herguth et al

[106] that the regeneration process at low and high temperatures might be different and has different activation energies.
In summary, B–O related defects are typical LID defects
in crystalline silicon. Passivation of B–O related defects is
crucial as it can significantly enhance the stable efficiency
of solar cells. There are two kinds of passivation for B–O
related defects, namely unstable passivation of B–O related
defects and permanent passivation of B–O related defects. Permanent passivation of B–O related defects gets more interest


from researchers as the degradation does not occur after permanent passivation. It is found that permanent passivation
requires hydrogen to participate in and the detailed mechanism might be hydrogen bonding with B–O related defects to
form a recombination inactive complex. Recent studies also
suggested that H[0] is directly responsible for permanent passivation and therefore carrier injection can dramatically enhance
the rate of permanent passivation.

_3.7. Possible role of hydrogen in LeTID_

Except for the typical LID induced by B–O related defects,
recent studies found that crystalline silicon also suffers from
LID in the conditions of light and elevated temperature, which
is named LeTID. LeTID is sometimes referred to carrier
induced degradation (CID) as it also occurs under current
injection at elevated temperature. LeTID exhibits many specific behaviors, such as the dependence on peak firing temperature and cooling rate, the possibility to be modulated by
dark annealing and etc. These interesting behaviors will be discussed later. Researchers also attempted to find out the mechanism of LeTID in crystalline silicon, however, up to date,
the defects responsible for LeTID is still unknown. Nevertheless, researchers still put forward two hypotheses to explain the
mechanism of LeTID. Among them, hydrogen is identified as
an ensured candidate to participate in LeTID.
To confirm the participation of hydrogen in LeTID, at first,
Bredemeier et al [107] compared the behaviors of LeTID
in wafers fired at 900 _[◦]C and 650_ _[◦]C, and only found the_
degradation in wafers fired at 900 _[◦]C. Chan et al [108] fur-_
ther reported that LeTID could be observed only when the
peak firing temperature exceeded 700 _[◦]C. These phenom-_
ena indicate that a species released from the firing process
can trigger LeTID, which is most likely hydrogen. Second,
Schmidt et al [109] found a direct correlation between the
extent of LeTID and the amount of hydrogen within silicon
bulk (as shown in figure 21), which confirmed that hydrogen participated in LeTID. Third, Chan et al [110] found
that post-firing dark annealing can alter the subsequent LeTID
degradation and regeneration. In detail, dark annealing at the
temperatures of 200 _[◦]C or below for 2.5 h was found to accel-_
erate the degradation and regeneration rates and the degradation severity, whereas after dark annealing at higher temperatures (above 200 _[◦]C) a new defect with a substantially longer_
degradation and regeneration rates emerged. This behavior is
consistent with the behavior of hydrogen in silicon. Fourth,
Jensen et al [111] found that hydrogen must be present in the
silicon bulk for the occurrence of LeTID in multicrystalline
silicon (mc-Si), as shown in figure 22. Please note that ‘fired’
means the sample gets MIRHP treatments first and then gets
fired to let hydrogen diffuses out of silicon bulk.
The detailed role that hydrogen plays in triggering LeTID
is discussed in some recent works. In detail, Weiser et al [112]
used infrared (IR) spectroscopy to detect the vibrational signatures due to the H–B, H–Ga, and H2[∗](C) (a metastable hydrogen dimer) defects in p-type mc-silicon wafers, and found that
LeTID degradation would reduce the concentrations of H–B,
H–Ga (as shown in figure 23), and therefore inferred that the

reaction, as illustrated in equation (9), including hydrogen and
an unknown species X, is used to explain the mechanism of
LeTID. At the beginning of the degradation, hydrogen and X
is forming the recombination active center HX responsible for
LeTID. Later, hydrogen is continuously depleted by another
reaction into H2C, and therefore the reversible reaction turns
back to the recombination inactive X, which is corresponding
to the regeneration process:

**H + X ↔** **HX.** (9)

In gallium doped crystalline silicon, LeTID also exists but

the mechanism is different. In literature, Winter et al [114]
reported that gallium doped crystalline silicon exhibited different degradation time constant with B-doped FZ silicon, but
the calculated activation energies for both materials were in
the narrow range of (0.58 ± 0.04) eV. Table 2 lists a collection
of reported activation energies of degradation and regeneration processes in LeTID induced by different treatments and
for diverse silicon materials. These data not only demonstrates
that LeTID can affect almost all kinds of silicon materials but
also provides some insight of potential participants of LeTID.
Furthermore, it is worth noting that there are some differences
among these values, which is probably caused by the influence from other crystallographic defects in these materials. It
is also found in the paper that the degradation in gallium doped
crystalline silicon is triggered by the fast-firing process when
the hydrogen rich passivation layers are present, which suggests that hydrogen is likely be involved in the LeTID formation in gallium doped silicon. Furthermore, Kwapil et al [72]
reported that the defect in degraded gallium doped silicon had
a capture cross sectional ratio of approximately 26, which
is typical for the LeTID defect. Besides, Grant et al [115]
found that dark annealing can have a significant impact on the
degradation kinetics of gallium doped crystalline silicon. In
detail, after dark annealing, the previously stabilized gallium

hydrogen attended in LeTID might come from the H–B and
H–Ga pairs. In addition, Chen et al [113] found a similarity in defect formation and recovery kinetics in both p-type
and n-type silicon, and inferred that the behavior of LeTID
both in the dark and under illumination might be explained
by the interactions between charged hydrogen species and
dopant atoms within the diffused layers and the silicon bulk.
Furthermore, recent work by Lin et al [30] proposed a new
model to explain LeTID. In their model, a simple reversible

doped PERC devices underwent a fast degradation followed
by a complete recovery, characteristic of LeTID, indicating
that the low-temperature dark anneal has undone the effects of
stabilization. Overall, the LeTID in gallium doped crystalline
silicon also needs the participation of hydrogen, but the kinetics are different with the LeTID in boron-doped crystalline
silicon, which might be due to the different binding energies
of H–B or H–Ga complexes [72].
In summary, LeTID is a common carrier injection induced
degradation phenomenon in crystalline silicon. Up to date, the
exact defect responsible for LeTID is still unknown. Nevertheless, hydrogen is confirmed, by many researchers, to participate in the formation of LeTID. There are many hypotheses
to explain the role of hydrogen in LeTID formation. Among
them, interstitial hydrogen bonding with an unknown species
X to form a recombination active complex is typically considered as a possible mechanism and H–B or H–Ga pairs are
confirmed to be the hydrogen source for interstitial hydrogen.

**4. Huge benefits of hydrogenation on**
**next-generation silicon solar cells**

Next generation silicon solar cells such as TOPCon and SHJ
have received intense interest from photovoltaic industry and
research institutes, as they have a much higher efficiency
limit up to 28.7% as compared to 24.5% for PERC solar
cells [121]. As TOPCon and SHJ solar cells typically have
much better surface passivation via the use of passivating contact technique, the bulk lifetime of the silicon wafer becomes
increasingly important for obtaining high efficiency in next
generation silicon solar cells. Up to date, the cell manufacturers typically use n-type Czochralski (Cz) silicon wafer as
the substrate for next-generation silicon solar cells, as Cz silicon wafer is relatively cheap and n-type silicon wafer is less
sensitive to metallic impurities. Nevertheless, n-type Cz-Si
wafer still suffers from the defects such as oxygen precipitates


and thermal donors. Fortunately, hydrogen is able to passivate oxygen precipitates and thermal donors and therefore is an
effective way to improve the bulk lifetime of n-type Cz silicon
wafer.
The typical defects in n-type Cz silicon, like oxygen precipitates, thermal donors and metallic impurities, can be well passivated by hydrogen. In terms of oxygen precipitates, Koizuka
_et al [122] reported that oxygen precipitates in n-type Cz sil-_
icon can induce two defect energy levels at about Ec − 0.25 eV
and Ev + 0.3 eV. Furthermore, hydrogen can passivate the
oxygen precipitates by reducing the defect density at the above
two energy levels. In addition, Hallam et al [123] found that
oxygen precipitates emerged as a ring-like pattern in photoluminescence image and could reduce the efficiency of the
cell up to 5% absolute. Advanced hydrogenation technique
is found to completely passivate oxygen precipitates with no
evident recombination activity present after passivation and in
the complete solar cells, as shown in figure 24. When the oxygen precipitates are contaminated with impurity, the case is
more complex. For instance, Li et al [124] demonstrated that
iron contamination can enhance the number of oxygen precipitates in silicon, but reduce the size of them. Besides, from
the results of EBIC test, the oxygen precipitates without iron
contamination have a shallow defect energy level, whereas
the oxygen precipitates with iron contamination have a deep
defect energy level. Nevertheless, hydrogen is able to passivate the oxygen precipitates both with and without iron contamination, although the effect is better for the contaminated one,
as shown in figure 25.
Hydrogen is also able to passivate thermal donors. For
instance, Johnson et al [125] reported that the concentration
of thermal donors in n-type silicon can be reduced by hydrogenation by a factor of 4.5, as shown by the DLTS result
in figure 26. Nevertheless, Rashkeev et al [126] found that
although hydrogen can passivate the thermal donors, the passivation effect is incomplete with a sizeable number of electrically active thermal donors still remaining in the sample

after hydrogenation. The reason might be that the hydrogenation of thermal donors in crystalline silicon is a reversible
reaction.

Although n-type silicon is insensitive to the typical metal
lic impurity like Fe, some metallic impurities like Ti, Cr, and
Ni even show severer recombination activity in n-type silicon.
Fortunately, hydrogen is still able to passivate these metallic
impurities like Ti. In detail, Leonard et al [127] reported that
a room-temperature hydrogen plasma has resulted in the suppression of DLTS signals due to interstitial Ti atoms and the
appearance of three strong DLTS peaks, which are related to
three different Ti-H complexes. Then after annealing of the
hydrogenated samples at 150 _[◦]C in nitrogen, the signals due_
to interstitial Ti and two of the three Ti-H complexes were not
detected in the spectra showing that almost complete passivation of all the electrically active defects occurred. The information on hydrogen passivation of Cr and Ni in n-type silicon is
discussed in section 3.2.

Moreover, the enhanced passivation of interface defects

is also the challenging issue in order to further improve
the electrical performance of TOPCon and SHJ solar cells.


For instance, Yang et al [130] found that the effective carrier lifetime of the n-Si/tunnel oxide/poly-Si structure can
be enhanced during illumination at elevated temperature
only when SiNx:H coating is present. Besides, by measuring the change of J0 during the carrier-induced hydrogenation treatment, they proposed that hydrogen is of significance in the enhanced Si/SiOx interface defects passivation.
More recently, Hu et al [128] also reported the improved
conversion efficiency of TOPCon solar cells by using current injection and annealing (CIA) treatment, as shown in
figure 27, which could also be related to the enhanced hydrogenation of interface defects. For details, the change in the
electrical properties of Si/SiO2 interface after hydrogenation
has been discussed in [129]. Furthermore, Polzin et al [131]
compared hydrogenation of Si/SiOx interface defects in polySi based passivating contact structures with different hydrogen sources by using different capping layers, as the evolution of effective lifetime during annealing given in figure 28.
Their results also confirmed the increased interface passivation
quality after thermal annealing with the participation of
hydrogen.

induced performance increase in SHJ solar cells has been
also reported by Wright et al [36], and Bao et al [138] more
recently. These experiments confirmed that the light soaking and annealing can efficiently enhance the conversion efficiency of SHJ solar cells with different initial efficiency and
from different production lines, which could be valuable for
the global PV industry.

**5. Conclusions**


At the beginning, the fundamental properties of hydrogen in
crystalline silicon are reviewed, including the diverse forms
of hydrogen in silicon, the charge states of hydrogen, the
hydrogen solubility, the hydrogen diffusivity and the hydrogen source. The important findings are concluded as follows.
First, hydrogen can dominantly exist in four forms in crystalline silicon, namely hydrogen platelet, hydrogen dimer, interstitial hydrogen and hydrogen bound state. These forms of
hydrogen have distinct electrical properties and may interact
with different defects. Among these four forms of hydrogen,
interstitial hydrogen is the most significant to hydrogenation
as it is chemically active to passivate defects. Second, interstitial hydrogen has three charge states: H[+], H[−] and H[0]. The
fractional concentrations of these charge states depend on the
position of Fermi level in silicon bandgap. In addition, it is
worth noting that different charge states of hydrogen have distinct electrical properties and manipulation of these charge
states is reported to enhance the performance of hydrogenation dramatically. Third, the diffusivity of hydrogen can be
influenced by temperature, electric field, the interactions with
dopants and etc. At high temperature regime, hydrogen diffusivity is determined by the diffusivity of interstitial hydrogen without any trap. At modest temperature regime, hydrogen
still dominantly diffuse in the form of interstitial hydrogen,
but its diffusivity is significantly reduced by the interactions
with dopants. At low temperature regime, the diffusivity of
hydrogen is determined by the diffusivity of hydrogen dimers,
which are very slow. Fourth, the hydrogenated silicon nitride
film (SiNx:H) is typically used as the hydrogen source for silicon solar cells. Generally, the refractive index of the SiNx:H
film can be modulated to vary the amount of atomic hydrogen into silicon bulk and this value need to be experimentally
adjusted to give better hydrogenation effect. Firing temperature also plays an important role on the amount of hydrogen
released from the SiNx:H film and typically 750 C will be

_[◦]_
best for hydrogen in-diffusion to silicon bulk.

Then, the applications of hydrogenation on diverse defects

in crystalline silicon are discussed in section 3, with the
emphasis on passivation kinetics and mechanism. First, dopant
passivation by hydrogen is a well-known phenomenon, and
it is found that the neutralization of dopant requires an
oppositely charged hydrogen to form complex. Nevertheless,
the dopant-hydrogen complex is not stable and can dissociate at elevated temperatures and under carrier injection.
Second, hydrogen is able to passivate most of typical metallic
impurities in crystalline silicon. However, the passivation
mechanisms for each metallic impurity is different. Generally,

parameters are given in the inset table. Reprinted from [138], with

As for SHJ solar cells, a structure of c-Si coated with

doped/intrinsic a-Si:H bilayers exactly is the key component of
SHJ solar cells, since the hydrogenated i-a-Si layers between
the c-Si bulk and the doped a-Si:H can efficiently passivate the
interface dangling bonds [132]. Hydrogen engineering in order
to improve the performance of SHJ solar cells has been widely
studied, for instance, Soman et al [133] reported that hydrogen
plasma with annealing as post-treatments for SHJ solar cells
leads to decreased reverse saturation current, which could be
attributed to the interface defects passivation, they also investigated the relation between the hydrogen plasma properties
to the passivation quality of c-Si surface [134]. Besides, Liu
_et al [135] found that the post H2 plasma treatment with resid-_
ual SiH4 molecules contributes to the formation of a dense
silicon layer which can inhibit the out diffusion of hydrogen
from bulk, thus, causing evident enhancement in the Jsc, V oc
and Eff of SHJ solar cells. Xu et al [136] also demonstrated
that microwave H2 plasma treatment before a-Si:H deposition
can effectively reduce surface recombination velocity as low
as 4 cm s[−][1].

The phenomenon of light induced performance increase

was also observed in SHJ solar cells, with the efficiency
gain of about 0.3%abs [137], as shown in figure 29. They
referred the improvement is related to the enhanced surface
passivation quality i.e. the reduction in the recombination active interface defect density, furthermore, the improvement
requires the presence of the doped a-Si:H layers. The light

it is found that the metallic impurity-H1 complex still has
some recombination activity, but with more hydrogen atoms
attaching to the metallic impurity, the complex becomes inactive. Third, hydrogen is also able to passivate dislocations
and grain boundaries, however, the passivation effectiveness
depends on the character of GB and the contamination level.
Furthermore, three important assumptions are concluded for
explaining the mechanism of hydrogenation on grain boundaries. Fourth, hydrogen is able to passivate silicon surface
states both with and without contamination. For clean silicon
surface, hydrogenation can reduce the density of silicon surface states to several folds smaller. For contaminated silicon
surface, hydrogenation can result in the agglomeration of the
two-dimensional metal layers into the three-dimensional metal
islands. Fifth, the regeneration process of B–O related defects
requires hydrogen to participate in and the detailed mechanism is found to be hydrogen bonding with B–O related defects
to form a recombination inactive complex. Moreover, recent
works indicated that H[0] is directly responsible for the regeneration process and therefore carrier injection such as laser illumination can dramatically enhance the rate of the regeneration process. Sixth, hydrogen typically is a passivation species
to deactivate defects, however, hydrogen becomes a species
to induce defect in the case of LeTID. Strong evidences are
found to prove that hydrogen is necessary for the formation
of LeTID in crystalline silicon. There are many hypotheses
to explain the role of hydrogen in LeTID formation. Among
them, interstitial hydrogen bonding with an unknown species
X to form a recombination active complex is typically considered as a possible mechanism and H–B pairs are confirmed
to be the hydrogen source for interstitial hydrogen.
At last, the benefits of hydrogenation on next-generation
silicon solar cells are reviewed. In detail, hydrogenation can
improve the conversion efficiency of TOPCon and SHJ solar
cells by more than 0.2% absolute. The mechanism of this
improvement lies on the hydrogenation of the defects, including the bulk defects such as oxygen precipitate, thermal donor
and some metallic impurities, and the interface defects around
the Si/SiOx and Si/a-Si interface. Fortunately, hydrogen can
well passivate these defects and make them recombination
inactive after hydrogenation, which will lead to the further
improvement of the electrical performance in these solar cells.
Future research may focus more on the microscopic mechanism of hydrogenation on typical defects in crystalline silicon
and find out the chemical compositions and configurations of
the hydrogen-defect complexes.
